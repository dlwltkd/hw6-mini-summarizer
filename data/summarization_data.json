    "document": "(CNN) -- Portuguese distance runner Helder Ornelas has been handed a four-year ban after becoming the first athlete to fall foul of the IAAF's Biological Passport program. After abnormalities in his \"blood profile\" were flagged up in May 2011, the world governing body went back to scrutinize a series of blood test results for the 38-year-old between December 2009 and November 2010. Three experts in the field of haematology concluded Ornelas had used a prohibited substance or a prohibited method and the IAAF referred the case to the Portuguese Athletic Federation for adjudication. Citing \"aggravating circumstances\" the IAAF sought an increased four-year sanction despite it being a Ornelas' first doping offense. Ornelas, who won the Milan Marathon in 2005 and finished eighth in the long race at the 2001 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, did not exercise his right of appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. IAAF President Lamine Diack said: \"Those who try to cheat within the athletics community should be warned that the Athlete Biological Passport is not merely a concept but rather an efficient method to identify, target and catch those who believe that doping is the only route to success. \"Cheaters should also be aware that, if they are caught, the IAAF will seek an increased four-year sanction whenever the circumstances so justify,\" he added in a statement released Wednesday.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- They're calling it the \"Crews missile.\" Fired from the keyboard of 67-year-old Nick Crews, the missive blew the lid off his dysfunctional family. In an e-mail titled \"Dear All Three,\" published in U.K. newspaper The Telegraph, Crews excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the \"bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out\" to him and his wife. Crews, a retired British naval officer, was fed up with his children's unsuccessful marriages and inability to earn a living that, as he said, measures up to their potential. \"I for one, and I sense Mum feels the same, have had enough of being forced to live through the never-ending bad dream of our children's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes.\" 5 ways to raise a grateful child . In the e-mail, made public with his permission by his daughter Emily, Crews describes his concern for his grandchildren. \"It makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you, their parents.\" And then this ultimatum: \"I want to hear no more from any of you until, if you feel inclined, you have a success or an achievement or a REALISTIC plan for the support and happiness of your children to tell me about.\" Whoa. This is beyond disappointment. This sounds just plain mean. Yet, the story, and support for Crews, has gone viral. It \"struck a chord,\" wrote Telegraph reporter Cristina Odone. Sure, what parent doesn't fear raising a bum? But as the mother of two young adult children, I had to wonder whether a withering e-mail attack was the best way to go about getting the kids to shape up. I asked Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, whether the former submarine captain took the right tack. For a parent fed up with his child's behavior, \"It can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart,\" said Saltz. But, she added, one must pave the way long before the children became adults, with a warm, communicative relationship. Although two of his children haven't spoken to him since receiving the note, \"Crews has been swamped with encouraging messages,\" writes Odone. Many are applauding Crews for \"telling it like it is.\" But does he? In the e-mail, he alludes to his own mistakes: \"Having done our best, probably misguidedly, to provide for our children...\" He describes his envy when hearing his friends brag about their children, and seems deeply wounded by the fact that his children don't consult him or his wife before making life decisions. The secret life of my sixth grader . Perhaps he played a larger role than he would admit, or even knows, in how his children turned out. He did acknowledge to Odone that due to his naval career, he was pretty much an absentee father. The Crews story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents. In the wake of the Great Recession, many parents have resigned themselves to the fact that their college-graduate children may not be moving out anytime soon and may not even have a job. A U.S. 2010 policy brief sponsored by Brown University showed that 43% of those under 25 live with their parents, up from 32% in 1980. But is the economy alone to blame for what I fondly call \"Deadbeat Kid Syndrome?\" \"Not everything is parenting and not everything is biology,\" said Saltz. \"There's a combination here.\" And sometimes, she added, families just have bad luck. Saltz said although Crews obviously loves his children, \"he ended up missing the mark\" with the e-mail. Still, the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing, Saltz said, especially in a world full of \"overly indulgent parents,\" who aren't teaching children life skills. Everyone's tweeting and boasting about their kids' successes, but missing an important point, failure is important too. \"If you don't teach your kids any resilience, you fail them out of everything,\" Saltz said. \"They need to fall down, say I fell down before but got back up, and I know I can do that.\" I'm guilty of this sort of thing. Growing up, I never once called my mother at work. Yet I allowed my own kids to call me all the time. It just took that much longer to wean them off the \"workday quickie advice call.\" Perhaps I should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own. Many parents have blinders on. If you don't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude, why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades, which they likely deserve, or for failing them for cheating? When heroes disappoint our kids . Timothy Law Snyder is vice president for academic affairs at Loyola University Maryland and lectures nationally about generational differences. Snyder says some parents blame the school or the professor, rather than the student, for bad grades, even when their child is caught plagiarizing. \"It's at its worst when the parent is living through their child,\" he said. \"The parents' successes, even life accomplishments, are identified entirely with those of their child.\" \"It used to be parents would go to the school and care that (their) kid has a moral compass and understands right and wrong,\" Saltz said. Nowadays, the concept of right and wrong isn't as clear. \"They're more concerned that the kid gets an A than be a kind person, a moral person.\" Saltz said parents are under pressure for things to look good and feel good. \"They love their children. .... But they've got tunnel vision.\" Case in point: when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well, or poorly, they've played. \"Children come out and experience nothing but success, not necessarily done by them but enabled by their parents, intervening all the time,\" Saltz said. Such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood, and that's not a good thing. Nor is having too many choices too soon. Take the beauty salon. How young is too young for a manicure? In my salon, there's a 4-year-old girl who's been getting \"mani-peds\" for two years. She loves the pedicure bath,\" the manicurist told me. What happens to that little girl when she grows up and can't afford manicures? And think, does your 6-year-old really need a cellphone? As for the Crews saga, Saltz said she hopes it makes a lot of people think about being more honest with their children. \"Someday they'll have to frustrate their child, disappoint their child, point out their child's mistakes. By doing those things earlier rather than later, they'll help their children to be better people.\" Would you write a letter like Crews' to your children? Do you think such a message would be effective in changing behavior? Leave your opinion in the comments section below. Like CNN Living on Facebook .",

    "document": "By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 09:30 EST, 20 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:43 EST, 21 August 2012 . The Tories have received hundreds of thousands of pounds from donors following controversial private dinners and parties with the Prime Minister. Latest figures reveal that £790,948 flowed into the party’s coffers from eight individuals who attended the secret Downing Street and Chequers meetings which caused a scandal earlier this year. A further £710,000 came from donors who attended ‘Leader’s Group meals’ with Mr Cameron and other senior Conservative politicians such as Home Secretary Theresa May and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Controversial donors: Millionaires who attended private dinners with David Cameron, left, and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, right, gave £710,000 . Labour said the fact that . millionaires were donating so much money after meeting Mr Cameron showed . the rich had too much influence over the party. In a sign that the public are growing . disenchanted with politics, the amount of money donated to political . parties declined between the first and second quarters of 2012. A total . of £7,873,478 in donations was reported to the Electoral Commission . between April and June: down £992,312 on the figure for the first three . months of the year. The Conservatives accepted £3,785,579 – down by around £250,000 on the previous quarter. Labour was trailing behind on . £2,964,471; down some £450,000 on the first quarter of 2012. However, . Lib Dem donations rose slightly to £717,797. Labour backbench MP Simon Danczuk . said: ‘David Cameron’s cosy dinners in No 10 have helped the Tories rake . in hundreds of thousands from millionaire donors in the last few . months, while over a million pounds has flooded into Tory coffers via . their exclusive Leader’s Club events where ministers rub shoulders with . only the very biggest donors. ‘With each day that passes it’s clear . that David Cameron’s Government is completely out of touch – wining and . dining the millionaires they gave a tax cut to in the Budget while . millions are paying more.’ In March, the Prime Minister was . forced to release a list of donors who had visited him at Downing Street . or his country residence, Chequers. The Electoral Commission figures . reveal that the Tories’ largest donation was £512,450 from one of those . who had been invited to Mr Cameron’s home, financier Michael Farmer. Other attendees who have donated money since the meetings were Lord . Stanley Fink (£74,000) and Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB . (£60,000). The Tories also raised hundreds of . thousands from people who attended Leader’s Group meals with senior . figures including Mr Cameron. Last night a spokesman for the Conservative Party denied that those who met the Prime Minister had influence over policy. ‘The Conservative Party continues to . enjoy a high level of financial support from generous philanthropists . committed to improving peoples’ lives across Britain,’ she said. Criticism: Nick Clegg came under attack last year after it was revealed he had dinner with Brompton's owner Rumi Verjee . ‘The Prime Minister occasionally has . dinner with party donors, as do other party leaders. There is no . suggestion of influence over government policy as a result of donations. Between them, these individuals give less than a quarter of the total . money donated to the Conservative Party.’ The spokesman pointed out that . Ed Miliband had dined with the leaders of Unite, Unison and Usdaw – . which between them gave £1,468,000 last quarter. The figures from the Electoral . Commission show that after the three main parties, the Greens came next . with £180,060 in donations. The British National Party took . £100,000 while UKIP garnered £29,370. Plaid Cymru recorded £17,500 while . the Scottish National Party only had £2,500. LABOUR is still in hock to union barons, it was claimed yesterday. Between April and June, some 70 per cent of the party’s donations – more than £2million – came from trade unions. The Conservatives said this was proof that the party was overwhelmingly reliant on the unions. However, Labour pointed out that the figures did not include revenue from ordinary members through their fees. Majority from trade unions: Since Ed Miliband became Labour leader, 81 per cent of the party's donations came from trade unions. Under Gordon Brown it was 59 per cent . The Electoral Commission report showed that since Ed Miliband became Labour leader, 81 per cent of the party’s donations came from the trade unions. Under Gordon Brown, the figure was 59 per cent. Labour’s biggest individual donor was Unite, the union led by the militant Len McCluskey. In the previous quarter it gave over £800,000, and since Mr Miliband took over it has given more than £6million. Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi said: ‘The boss of Labour’s biggest donor is threatening British businesses with more strikes as his trade union continues its takeover of the Labour party. ‘With Labour still overwhelmingly reliant on union cash, it’s clear Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey and the other barons who anointed him Labour leader.’ Ed Miliband was only elected leader with the help of the union vote. Labour MPs and party members chose his brother, David. The figures show that Labour received £2.96million in public donations, of which £2.07million came from the unions. Unite gave £840,725 – in itself a massive 28 per cent of total donations. It was the largest single donation to any party. Labour received £429,558 from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers; and £313,863 from the GMB. Another £213,000 came from Unison. A Labour source said it was wrong to suggest that the unions had undue influence over the party leadership. ‘We welcome the unions’ support but it would be wrong to suggest that in any way it gains them undue influence over policy or that they are the sole source of the party’s funding,’ he added. A Unite spokesman said trade union donations were among the ‘cleanest money in politics’ and are transparently given.",
    "summary": "Tories got the most cash gifts between April and June this year out of a total £7.8m handed to all parties . More than half Labour's donations come from unions, but got £500,000 less than three months earlier . A rift between union leaders and Labour over policy is being blamed ."

    "document": "By . Joani Walsh . PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:41 EST, 29 October 2013 . With a supermodel daughter, it is natural to assume that Valerie Campbell would be as looks-obsessed as the modelling industry. Yet when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast and underwent a mastectomy, Valerie, 61, decided against the reconstructive surgery that might have maintained her perfect figure. 'After what I’d been through, my looks weren’t important,’ says Valerie, who lives in Surrey. 'When you’re staring into the chasm between life and death, you put things into perspective and whether I was left with one arm, one eye or one breast, staying alive was what mattered. Glamorous: Naomi Campbell and mother Valerie after the latter's operation . 'I didn’t have concerns about reconstructive surgery - that’s not why I turned it down - but it was unnecessary to me; my legs are more important to how I feel about my appearance than my breasts - and it wasn’t worth the risk, or physical trauma. Besides, I’m scared of needles.’ Eight years after Valerie’s diagnosis, she has no regrets - although friends and family are still surprised by it. 'Even now Naomi rings me up and says, “Mum, why don’t you have a reconstruction?”. I think my daughter worries that’s the reason I’m on my own, that maybe I’m scared of intimacy. But it couldn’t be further from the truth. 'I can live without my breast. It hasn’t changed my character or affected my body image. I still wear low-cut tops and swimming costumes - I use prosthetics. If I’m not bothered about what my chest looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, he won’t care.’ Valerie is not alone in deciding against reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. Around 17,000 women a year have a mastectomy, but only a quarter have reconstructive surgery, according to the National Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction Audit of England and Wales published last year. The majority of reconstructions are performed at the same time as surgery to remove the cancer. Women who wait often want time to accept their diagnosis and its impact on their self-image. Mother-daughter duo (pictured in 1992): 'You don't argue with Naomi,' laughs Valerie about her daughter's insistence she be seen by a specialist in the U.S. But most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction. 'In specialist centres that offer reconstruction routinely and have access to highly trained surgeons, only about 40 to 50 per cent of women have one,’ says Fiona MacNeill, consultant breast surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, West London. Ms MacNeill says that women often find their daughters are the ones encouraging them to have reconstructions. 'The daughters are usually transferring feelings about their own self-image - they’re sure they would choose one so think it must be right for their mother,’ says Ms MacNeill. 'Women have different relationships with their breasts throughout their lives. A lot of older women, particularly mothers, see their breasts as functional and now they’ve served their purpose are less affected by their loss, while younger women are more likely to have reconstructions.’ A reconstruction is major surgery and can take three months to recover from, which also puts women off, she adds. 'Their breasts are never going to look, feel or have the same sensation as before treatment. Some patients take pride in their scars and see them as a sign of winning a battle.’ Others may see their breasts as a threat that could potentially kill them, so are not concerned about losing them. 'If I’m not bothered about what my chest . looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, . he won’t care.’ 'As long as they’re fully informed about options, women tend to make the best decisions for themselves,’ adds Ms MacNeill. Therein lies a problem, as many women are not fully informed about their options, says Joe O’Donoghue, plastic surgeon and British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons member, who co-authored the audit. Lack of awareness of the options and access to specialist plastic surgeons play a significant role in the low rates of reconstructions. The audit found more than a third of women surveyed said the risks and benefits of reconstruction were never discussed. Options include an implant-based reconstruction, or a tissue reconstruction that involves skin, fat and muscle grafting. Reconstructive surgery is not risk-free - 35 five per cent of women who have implant reconstructions undergo a 'revision’ operation within five years due to problems, including capsular contracture (when tissue forms around the implant, causing hardness and pain) - or asymmetry. 'The surviving breast will naturally age, while the implant hasn’t,’ explains Mr O’Donoghue. This problem is avoided with a tissue reconstruction as the breast ages the same way as the other breast and changes size, but the surgery is longer, more complex, and leaves scars. Valerie had an advanced invasive ductal carcinoma - cancer affecting the cells lining the milk ducts. She had felt a lump while bathing and was soon referred to the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, Surrey. She was given a biopsy and then the shocking news that she had cancer, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. Like daughter, like mother: Valerie, pictured on the catwalk, joins many other women in refusing reconstructive surgery . 'My younger sister, Yvonne, who came with me to get the diagnosis, was bawling her eyes out, but it felt like the doctor was talking to someone else. All I heard was “cancer” and “advanced”.’ Delivering the news to her children Pierre, then 21 and training to be an actor in New York, and Naomi, then 35, who was working in Europe, was emotional. 'Everyone cried but me - I was shell-shocked.’ But Valerie remained positive. 'I said to Naomi: “Wherever this has come from, it’s going right back,” and she said she knew I’d be fine.’ Naomi insisted Valerie got a second opinion from a specialist in the U.S. 'You don’t argue with Naomi,’ Valerie laughs. Valerie, who by now had been referred to the Royal Marsden, immediately started chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, before doctors decided that Valerie should have a mastectomy. Valerie was also seeing specialists at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Centre in the U.S. and she opted to have the surgery - removing her breast and affected lymph nodes - there. 'Naomi arranged an apartment for me near the Mayo Clinic while I recuperated.’ Valerie stayed there for three months while undergoing radiotherapy. Back in the UK, Valerie started hormone therapy with the drug anastrozole, which stops the production of oestrogen and cuts the risk of breast cancer recurring. Valerie took anastrozole for seven years, but stopped because of the side-effects. 'It made me so puffy I couldn’t see my cheekbones, I was bloated, tired, moody, had pins and needles - you name it.’ Her regular check-ups ended after five years, and she now has the three-yearly mammograms that are offered by the NHS. 'I’ve been free of cancer so long I don’t think about it any more. Now I see and appreciate the detail in life, as if someone’s turned up the colour. I’ve found myself again and I want other women going through it to know that’s possible - with or without your breasts.’ Valerie Campbell is working on a natural skincare line with Perfect Look & Health products, which will donate 20 per cent of profits from sales of products during October to breast cancer research: lookandhealth.co.uk .",
    "summary": "'I can live without my breast,' says Valerie - and so can many others . Most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction . This may be because it is major surgery, often taking 3 months to recover . And it's not risk-free: over a third who have it undergo 'revision' surgery ."

    "document": "Labour and disability charities are facing a growing public backlash for making a ‘disgusting spectacle’ of remarks by a Government minister about minimum pay for disabled workers. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle looked shocked as a BBC Question Time audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister Lord Freud should resign or be sacked. She insisted the peer had been ‘offensive’ in remarks secretly recorded by a Labour official at a fringe meeting of last month’s Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video . Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle on Question Time when she demanded Lord Freud be sacked . Lord Freud was responding to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the Government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. Labour leader Ed Miliband ambushed David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, also insisting the minister should be sacked. He has remained in his job after apologising, but Miss Eagle insisted on Thursday night: ‘I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. ‘There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn’t to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on the programme it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state ‘topping up’ the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage . One audience member agreed: ‘I think Angela Eagle is being extremely disingenuous. I think we all knew what he meant, even though he said it clumsily.’ Another person in the audience in Newbury, Berkshire, told Miss Eagle: ‘What you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it’s disgusting.’ A young woman said: ‘I just wanted to see whether you [Eagle] would use this as a political football and you have done – thanks Angela.’ Yesterday a Conservative MP also defended Lord Freud, insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people’s chances of finding work. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said the way Lord Freud’s remarks had been twisted by Labour and parts of the charitable sector was ‘frankly disgusting’. It emerged the charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part-time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage. In 2000, it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‘low output work’ to be exempted from the rules. It now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on, ‘as has our position’. Conservative MP Henry Smith said: ‘Certain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue. Charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for Labour’s political point scoring.’ Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, whose wife Margaret was badly disabled in the Brighton bomb, said the attacks on Lord Freud were a ‘disgusting spectacle’. ‘What Lord Freud was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who cannot produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of £6 an hour. My wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of IRA/Sinn Fein crippled her. She is worth no less today, but she could not justify a pay rate of £6 an hour. Lord Freud was mulling over how to help such people.’ Labour's Department for Trade and Industry published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage. The department, then run by Patricia Hewitt, said the minimum wage applied to all workers – able-bodied or disabled. However, disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work-related activity for therapeutic reasons, with no contractual obligation to work. The guidance gave various examples of when that could apply, after the Government consulted with organisations including Scope, Mencap and the TUC. It gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture, horticulture, caring for animals and training. Other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems, which it suggested, could pay them as little as £4 per day. A third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly. They could be paid varying amounts up to just £20 per week.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Investigators and community members in Tennessee continued their hunt Sunday for a 20-year-old nursing student, offering a fresh appeal for tips on the man they believe forcibly took her from her home last week. Holly Bobo was on her way to school when her brother saw her being led from their Darden, Tennessee, home into the woods by a man wearing camouflage, said John Mehr, special agent in charge for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Mehr's state agency urged people Sunday \"to take notice of anyone whose whereabouts were unaccounted for Wednesday morning, when Holly went missing, and changes in behavior since the incident.\" Police have not yet named anyone who they believe was behind the alleged kidnapping. \"It's possible the suspect missed work or appointments last Wednesday, Thursday or Friday unexpectedly,\" the bureau of investigation said in a statement. \"He may also have excessively cleaned a car or ATV, suddenly sold a vehicle, or reported it stolen. The suspect may be showing signs of anxiety or stress.\" The community, which is near Parsons, is offering $25,000 for information that helps authorities locate Bobo and/or arrest her alleged abductor. While authorities have backed away from their earlier assertion that Bobo was dragged away, they do not believe she went willingly either. \"We feel she was in fear of her life so she was compliant with his demands,\" Mehr has said. As of Sunday, the investigative bureau said law enforcement had gotten more than 250 leads. Search teams were combing for evidence in parts of Decatur and Henderson counties, including in Natchez State Park. On Saturday, the state agency had said teams were looking in parts of Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Decatur County Mayor Michael Smith told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday that new evidence had been found in the search for Bobo, who was taking nursing classes at a Tennessee Technology Center campus in Parsons. Smith wouldn't elaborate on what type of evidence was found, but CNN has learned that a white lunch box was found near a creek eight miles away. Bobo is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs about 110 pounds. She was last seen wearing a pink shirt and light blue jeans. The case has galvanized many in the rural central Tennessee community, which is roughly halfway between Memphis and Nashville. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- have turned out in recent days to hunt for clues, while many more have attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via several groups on Facebook. \"We're just all close,\" one volunteer, Bryan Smith, told CNN affiliate KSMV. \"Everybody's close in this town and the county.\" Her parents, meanwhile, have struggled to come to grips with their daughter's disappearance. Her mother, Karen Bobo, cried throughout her husband's brief statement to reporters Thursday and then spoke directly to Holly and whoever might know what has become of her. \"Holly, I love you so much. Please try to get home to us.\" Karen Bobo said. \"She's ... so precious, you just don't even know. I just want her back.\"",

    "document": "By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . A restaurant owner has caused outrage by telling customers they can no longer share meals when in large groups and demanded they order individual dishes and drinks. Martin Duncan, owner of Freestyle Tout, which boasts the 'best desserts in Brisbane, took to Facebook on Monday to inform patrons of the rules during peak business times - but his post sparked anger among some regulars. 'We would really really appreciate each individual guest purchasing a meal or dessert and a beverage,' he wrote. Freestyle Tout owner Martin Duncan has caused controversy by demanding all customers order something when they visit his cafe . 'We would like to reserve table space for paying customers. 'Sorry to put it plainly but large groups not eating or drinking does not pay our rent or the wages of our fabulous staff. If you must share please purchase a drink.' But some diners were not happy with being told what to do and said the business would lose customers if they weren't more welcoming. One diner responded: 'Don't tell me what to do Freestyle? I will purchase what I want! What an absolute joke! This guy is going to lose all his business'. 'I always share a dessert when I go places simply because I can't eat that much food. I don't think it's healthy or fair to force people to eat when they are not hungry. It's such a waste of money for me to eat a meal and send half of it back when I go out, so my partner and I usually share,' another patron wrote. Others were more supportive of the new move. 'It is a reasonable request, I am with the owners,' one person said. The Brisbane restaurant is urging diners to order their own food and beverages instead of sharing meals . Following the reaction, Mr Duncan said his message may have been a 'little misconstrued'. 'To help set the record straight there are no \"rules\" regarding dining at Freestyle Tout,' he wrote in a latter post. 'There is no issue with people sharing meals, after all, the sharing of food is one of life's great joys.' But Mr Duncan continued to explain the reasoning behind his original plea. 'The issue I am speaking out about is when large groups of say, 10 or 20 people share for instance, 2 meals/desserts, or share 4 coffees or even worse, try bringing in their own food from home, especially when there are customers waiting for a seat,' he wrote.

    "document": "Premier League matches will be played on Friday nights from summer 2016 under the next TV deal but the Mail on Sunday can reveal that another more radical proposal — league games played overseas — will not happen for the foreseeable future. Fan power has seen the idea shelved, perhaps for good. The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore wants overseas games to happen, following the lead of the most lucrative sports league in the world, the NFL. Most of the Premier League’s clubs, led by the major foreign-owned sides, want them to happen. Meaningful games in foreign host cities could earn tens of millions per match. But home-based supporters’ opposition seems to have kiboshed the notion. Premier League stars such as Oliver Giroud (above) are set to be a hit around the world . The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore (centre) wants overseas games to happen . Sergio Aguero, November's Premier League player of the month, could now be scoring goals on a Friday . ‘The clubs are keen for us to keep developing the concept but we’re no nearer,’ said Scudamore, who first proposed in 2008 that a ‘39th game’ be played abroad each year, in an exclusive interview. ‘The idea of an extra game is gone. Whether you play a regular season game (overseas), that has challenges, not least among the fans, which we take into consideration. ‘I’ve never shied away from the fact that personally I think it’s a good idea. I bear the scars from thinking it’s a good idea. A lot of the clubs think it’s a good idea... but there is absolutely no time line and no idea when it might happen.’ Asked to confirm that an overseas game will not happen foreseeably, in the next TV round and before 2020 at the earliest, Scudamore said: ‘You can make that assumption.’ Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and that number could go up with the new deal . The Premier League tender document for UK live TV rights for 2016-19 is just dropping on the desks of senior executives at major broadcasters. The Premier League will sell 168 live games per season to UK television from 2016-17 to 2018-2019, up from 154 games now. Those games will be sold in seven packages, five of 28 games and two of 14 per year, and about 10 games per season will be on Friday nights. No buyer will be allowed more than 126 games per season. The Premier League currently make £3.018billion from Sky and BT for domestic live rights for 2013-16 and about £2.9bn more combined from foreign live rights (£2.2bn), highlights, near-live rights and mobile clip rights. These massive sums flow to the clubs, who in turn spend it buying and paying big-name players, most of them foreign, and therefore attractive to global audiences. So a ‘virtuous circle’ of growth continues. BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013 . The Premier League will soon boast the second biggest annual income from broadcast rights in the world, according to a report from industry specialists TV Sports Markets. The English top flight currently sits in third place, behind the figures for American football and baseball in the US. But the next TV deal could soar to £7.5bn between 2016-19, an annual income of £2.5bn, which would take the Premier League second. And 38 per cent of the League’s broadcast income is from overseas, already the highest ratio by far in the world. 1 NFL £4.14billion . (American football income from broadcast rights in 2014) 2 MLB £1.94billion . (American baseball) 3 Premier League £1.91billion . (Domestic and overseas income) 4 NBA £1.21billion . (American basketball) 5 Champions League . 6 Serie A . 7 Olympics . 8 NHL . 9 Ligue 1 (France) 10 La Liga (Spain) Analysts and insiders have contrasting views of how much these deals could grow but everyone agrees they will grow. It would be no surprise to see the total three-year pot soar from £5.9bn to £7.5bn, and if major new players such as Qatar-owned beIN SPORTS come to the table for the UK rights, as long suggested, it could yet be more. The Premier League’s global appeal is being highlighted this weekend at ‘BPL Live’, a huge public event in Mumbai, India, where 20,000 fans from the sub-continent are gathering in a public park, essentially to watch Premier League matches on a big screen. Yesterday they watched Chelsea play Hull on one screen and Leicester host Manchester City on another. Today they will be treated to Manchester United against Liverpool. There is also a tented village where fans can be photographed with the Premier League trophy, visit exhibitions by the League’s clubs and meet a range of ‘legends’ including former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler. Vijay Kuppili, a 30-year-old manager with an online company, has made a two-hour flight from his home town in south-east India specifically to attend BPL Live this weekend. ‘I’ve been following the Premier League for 10 years, since Arsenal’s Invincibles,’ he said, although he is a Manchester United fan, through admiration of Sir Alex Ferguson’s management and teams. He and college mates, variously fans of United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, watched whatever games they could as students in their communal digs, and remain hard-core fans today. Interest has also soared again in the past year, he says, because the coverage within India has improved, with more games and higher broadcasting standards. The NFL has made lucrative sums of money by staging a host of games at Wembley Stadium . Colin Kaepernick scores a touchdown for the San Francisco 49s against Jacksonville Jaguars in London . That can be explained by STAR TV’s investment. The rights holders on the sub-continent paid £93m for their current three-year rights, up from £29m previously. They have also invested in new commentators, some of them trained in England by veterans including Sky’s Martin Tyler, and now offer games in multiple languages. ‘Football is an aspirational sport and India has a committed fan following for the Barclays Premier League,’ said STAR’s chief operating officer, Sanjay Gupta. ‘BPL Live is a great initiative to take fans closer to the game, its iconic clubs and legendary heroes.’ Schmeichel, in Mumbai to help promote the event, said interest in the Premier League in India is ‘massive’. He has also travelled extensively as a United ambassador and adds: ‘Every time I go somewhere I’m still genuinely taken aback at how big United are.’ Champions Manchester City are set for Premier League games on a Friday night under a new rights package . Yesterday he went to the Leicester City tent at BPL Live to have a FaceTime chat with his son Kasper, Leicester’s goalkeeper, back home. ‘I was surprised to see how many people were in there, the interest here is in the League as a whole, not just one club,’ Schmeichel Snr said. ‘There are people in Chelsea shirts, and United, Liverpool, but also Leicester and other clubs.’ Scudamore sees India as one of eight key ‘strategic’ international markets where the rights values can soar in the 2016-19 sales round. The USA and China are also in that bracket. ‘The size of the market, the potential growth in the market and also the appetite of local partners to develop that market — when you get those three things coming together, that’s what determines it,’ he explained. He knows that the League is most likely to see a surge in TV income in any market, domestic or foreign, where two or more rival broadcasters both desperately want the rights. Chelsea fans sing during the Barclays Premier League 'Live' event in Mumbai, India . ‘Growth tends to be driven, historically, by competitive tension,’ he said. ‘Where there is competitive tension our rights grow and where there isn’t any they tend not to grow. Therefore it’s difficult to forecast. But do I see headroom? Yes. Do I see growth? Yes.’ Independent analysts agree. Kevin McCullagh of industry specialists TV Sports Markets, said: ‘The Premier League’s international rights value is the envy of sports properties around the world, including the biggest US leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and NBA. ‘There is still room for growth in Premier League international rights values. Crucially, it is popular in many regions with growing pay-television industries, such as in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin America. Pay-television has been the big driver of sports rights values around the world. It is also benefiting from the rise of football in the US — football rights fees have been growing strongly there in recent years.’",

Craig Brittain, whose website posted nude photos of women without their knowledge or permission, is seeking the removal of the articles on the grounds that they feature pictures of him that were used without his consent. The 28-year-old's now defunct site, Isanybodydown.com,also allegedly charged a 'take-down' fee for victims who want their photos removed. Craig Brittain, 28, who was behind a controversial revenge porn site, has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business . The site was banned from posting or sharing revenge porn photos or video by America's Federal Trade Commission earlier this year. Brittain sent a Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) take down to Google objecting to 23 articles remaining in their search rankings, according to the Daily Mirror. In the notice, which is published online, he claims that images, statements and other identity information was used in the stories without his permission. He states that it came from isanybodydown.com and his Facebook page. The DMCA notice was received on February 9, but at present no action has been taken by Google. The DMCA is a US law that was created in 1998 to protect against copyright infringements. Brittain was alleged to have used 'deception to acquire and post intimate images of women' for isanybodydown.com, according to the FTC complaint. Posing as a woman, he reportedly used websites such as Craigslist to obtain explicit photos, offering nude photos of himself in exchange. Men were also said to have given him photos of naked women, as a way to take revenge for being spurned. The FTC says his site featured images of more than 1,000 people and he made about $12,000 while it was up and running. Isanybodydown.com was banned from publishing nude pictures without the consent of the subject last month . Last month Brittain agreed to not publish any nude pictures without the consent of the subject and to destroy his collection, the FTC said. Speaking after the decision Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection said: 'This behavior is not only illegal but reprehensible. 'I am pleased that as a result of this settlement, the illegally collected images and information will be deleted.' In a statement posted on the website after it was closed down Brittain of Colorado said: 'I want to apologize to those who were affected by Is Anybody Down. 'I made a series of poor decisions, then tried to rationalize them, and made it even worse. 'I am sorry for the damage that I caused to everyone that ended up on my website. ' I am making amends at every opportunity. I regularly volunteer for, and donate to charitable organizations (I encourage you to do the same!). 'I ask for your forgiveness. What I did was wrong.'",

    "document": "ANDORRA LA VELLA, Andorra (CNN) -- Getting to Andorra, a tiny country wedged in the mountains between France and Spain, is no easy feat. No airport, no train station, and the nearest city Toulouse is at least a 2 hour drive away. Andorra, a beautiful mini-country in the Pyrenees, offers its residents a peaceful life. Perhaps that's part of the secret of this tiny principality high up in the Pyrenees Mountains: that its quiet isolation has created a relatively stress-free life-style which has made them the world champions in the global longevity sweepstakes, at least according to the latest U.S. Census Department estimates. The average Andorran today can expect to live at least 85 years -- longer than anywhere else on the planet. Meeting Andorrans from all walks of life, it soon becomes clear that the concept of living longer was not on everyone's mind, but the idea of living well and living healthy came up in nearly every conversation. From doctors in town to the elderly shepherd in the mountains, they speak of eating good natural food and of the exercise which comes naturally in walking up and down the hillsides. Dr. Albert Font, Director of Andorra's Geriatric Clinic, is convinced that living in the mountains is, in general, healthier both for mind and body: \"It's because we have this natural environment that we have such a balanced health,\" he told CNN. Watch a report on the secrets of long life in Andorra » . Elderly Andorrans have a daily routine that would put much younger people in the shade: outside their Assisted Living Residence, a group of about 30 senior citizens in their 80's and 90's out for a cold morning's walk went slowly but surely and easily negotiated two or three flights of stairs built into the mountainside. After that 'warm-up' most of them headed for the gym for stationary bike riding and exercise class. Diet and nutrition awareness also seems to play a role in keeping Andorrans alive and healthy. Nestled in valleys between France and Spain, there is very little cultivatable land and strangely enough, tobacco seems to be one of the few crops raised on the little farmland in the country. But meat, vegetables and fish from its larger neighbors make their way to the dinner tables in Andorra, resulting in a high-altitude version of the Mediterranean diet so many strive for elsewhere. But even in this land-locked little country, times are changing and the older generation worries that the slow invasion of fast food and the passivity of video games and the like, may have a negative impact on the life expectancy of the young. Seventy-six-year old farmer Pierre Font Vergas remembers the days when just taking his herd of cattle to pastures and back home again would easily mean hiking 30 kilometers (18 miles) up and down the mountain trails each day. A new lifestyle has come to the principality, the old farmer told CNN. Skiing and tourism are the country's new profit centers, life is getting increasingly stressful, more people are eating fast food instead of the traditional diet and not getting enough exercise, he added. It would seem that the secrets to long life in Andorra are not really secrets at all. They are well documented. Good health care, clean water, proper diet, plenty of exercise and a low-stress, positive life . However, there's one other thing to consider when trying to understand the Andorran's penchant for life and living long: the feeling of community and an unusual closeness to friends and family. Filming at an elderly care home, it was full of families including young children spending an hour or two on a weekday with an aged parent or grandparent. And even to stop to ask a question or a direction, people seemed to know about everything and everyone else in the country. Some might find that intrusive, or even boring. But there seemed to be a marked sense of peace in the way people here see life. Dr. Font thinks there is a specific reason for that sense of happiness in Andorra: \"We don't have any violence. I think it's one of the safest countries in the world.\" \"And after all,\" one Andorran told CNN, \"unlike the rest of Europe, we haven't been touched by a war in more than 700 years.\"",

    "document": "Every five minutes a woman in India is compelled to visit a police station and report a case of cruelty -- usually one committed by her own husband or family. Every ten minutes a woman in India reports assault. Every 21 minutes one of them reports a rape. The numbers are no secret: you can do the math from the National Crime Records Bureau yourself. The total number of these assorted cases has increased in each of the last five documented years, making for a 25% jump over this period. But the numbers don't tell the complete truth. At the very least, they are frequently misrepresented. With each high profile rape in India -- sensationally reported in national and sometimes international media -- the increased number of reported crimes is cited as an example of how the incidence rape in India is on a steep upward curve. But it's a lazy correlation. In reality, we don't really know that the number of cases of rape are on the rise. All we know is that more women are reporting these crimes -- perhaps, in part, because of the spotlight on them. Either way, the number of women not reporting rapes and other crimes is a far bigger statistic -- many are undocumented, brushed under the carpet, forgotten. Gender gap . How do we explain why India has so many cases? There are likely a number of complex sociological factors but there's not much hard data. One useful indicator of the safety of Indian women is to look at how they compare globally on freedom. The World Economic Forum's new Gender Gap Index gives India a dismal scorecard -- worse than in previous years. India's women rank 134th in the world (out of 142 countries) for economic opportunities; they place 126th in the world for educational attainment; 141st in the world for health and survival. These are all basic rights that would empower them, make them less likely to be silent victims. SURVEY: Women earn much less than men generally . The only parameter India performs well on is on having a female head of state or government, where it ranks a surprising first. But the parameter itself is flawed. In 15 of the 21 years the study counts, Indira Gandhi was prime minister. History will hardly portray Gandhi's achievements as solely a triumph for Indian women; her victory and the length of her rule was also a triumph of her lineage (Gandhi's father was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. She shared no relation to the legendary Mahatma Gandhi, but her surname -- acquired through marriage -- didn't hurt.) A more reliable indicator of the political empowerment of India's women is how it places 111th in the world for electing female parliamentarians, and 107th in the world for voting in female ministers. Born at a disadvantage . Why the sorry state of India's women? Why are they so far behind? The sad reality is that it begins before women are even born. According to India's census, there are 940 women for every 1,000 men. In part, the difference exists because of decades of female infanticide -- the practice where families abort fetuses on discovering their sex. When girls are born, they're born with the promise of a second class life. While men enjoy a literacy rate of 82%, only 65% of Indian women can read or write. Girls in India have long been considered a burden, a cause for losing money in marriages and dowries. Data and anecdotes alike show that Indian women have been unwanted and unloved for decades. Consider how families pressure their daughters-in-law for baby boys, not girls. Consider how in rural India, many Indian parents mistreat their daughters-in-law, demanding dowries, mothers-in-law meting out the same discrimination they were once subjected to. An overwhelming 43% of crimes reported by Indian women are acts of cruelty committed by their own families. Millions of Indians -- men and women -- are complicit. The discrimination continues at a policy level: marital rape is still not considered a crime in India. Local governments and police remain poorly equipped to process crimes against women -- let alone doing so in a sensitive manner. So why are many shocked by India's abysmal statistics on crimes against women? The crimes, as always, begin at home. It should be no surprise to read about the physical crimes reported and recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau. What is surprising is how generations of Indians have stood by as their mothers, sisters, and daughters have been left behind on every indicator of quality of life; they have been denied the chance for basic equality. The WEF report makes for illuminating reading, and signposts where India needs to go to fully realize the potential of its 600 million female inhabitants. OPINION: Where have India's females gone?",

    "document": "By . Sarah Griffiths . Spinal injury victims left paralysed have been offered new hope of walking again thanks to a breakthrough in stem cell science. U.S. scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient’s own cells for the first time. Implanting the cells in rats, they found that the neurons caused the animals’ nervous systems to rewire the spinal cord and brain. Scroll down for video . Spinal injury victims left paralysed (illustrated with a stock image) have been offered new hope of one day walking again, after U.S. scientists re-grew spinal cord neurons from a patient's own cells for the first time . Scientists took skin cells from an 86-year old man. They ‘wound the clock back’ so that the cells became stem cells again and were able to transform into any cell in the body. These stem cells were turned into neurons.They were injected into the spinal cords of paralysed . rats. In three months the neurons had made connections into the rats’ brains and along the length of their spinal cords. The new nerves extended into their limbs too. While this marks a scientific breakthrough, the rats were unable to walk again. The cells used to grow the neurons were taken from a healthy 86-year old man. They were converted into stem cell and then neurons. Researchers grafted the neurons into rats with spinal cord injuries that were two weeks old. They quickly formed tens of thousands of connections into the animal’s brain and along the spinal cord, according to the study published in Neuron. The connections extended out into the limbs of the injured rats’ limbs and bodies – ‘virtually the entire length of the animals’ central nervous system’. Mark Tuszynski, professor of neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego said that three months later the cells grafted ‘across long distances in the rats' spinal cords, even extending to the brain’ by ‘traversing wound tissues to penetrate and connect’. This image depicts extension of human nerve fibres into a rat's brain three months after spinal cord injury. Green fluorescent protein identifies human graft-derived nerve fibres, and red indicates host rat spinal cord white matter. Blue marks host rat grey matter . Lead scientist Dr Paul Lu of the university, said the human neurons ‘extended through the white matter of the injury sites, frequently penetrating adjacent grey matter to form synapses with rat neurons.’ ‘These findings indicate that intrinsic neuronal mechanisms readily overcome the barriers created by a spinal cord injury to extend many axons [nerve fibres] over very long distances, and that these capabilities persist even in neurons reprogrammed from very aged human cells.’ While the animals did not walk again, the experts still said they had made a breakthrough. And they believe that the build-up of scar tissue where the cells were implanted, could have prevented the rats from moving. Professor Tuszynski said: ‘Me and the team are now attempting to identify the most promising neural stem cell type for repairing spinal cord injuries. ‘We are trying to do as much as we possibly can to identify the best way of translating neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury to patients.’ For years the experts have been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury does not have to result in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Scientists are so keen to use a patient’s own cells because they are more likely to be accepted by a person’s own body preventing them from having to stake strong immunosuppressant drugs for life. For years the expert has been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury results in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons (illustrated) are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off . Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off. Professor Tuszynski said : ‘Earlier work has shown that grafted stem cells reprogrammed to become neurons can, in fact, form new, functional circuits across an injury site, with the treated animals experiencing some restored ability to move affected limbs.’ However, he warned that further tests to find out how best to graft stem cells and cure paralysis could take ‘months to years’. He also said that experts should be cautious when conducting a human trial in the future. ‘The enormous outgrowth of axons [verve fibres] to many regions of the spinal cord and even deeply into the brain raises questions of possible harmful side effects if axons are mistargeted. ‘We need to learn if the new connections formed by axons are stable over time, and if implanted human neural stem cells are maturing on a human time frame – months to years – or more rapidly.’",

The families of two friends who vanished during a late-night fishing trip have asked people to pray for their safe return as divers prepare to comb a lake for their bodies. Detective searching for Mason Cox and David Wood, both 20, are baffled by their disappearance more than a week ago. They were last seen on Thursday January 2 before they headed to Lake Lanier in Dawsonville, Georgia, about 60 miles north of Atlanta. Mystery: David Wood, left, and Mason Cox, right, vanished on a late-night fishing trip . But their fishing equipment had been left behind and they both left personal belongings at Mr Cox's family home. Police have no evidence of foul play but have been using cadaver dogs, specially trained to follow the scent of bodies, to scour the area where they were last seen. Dawson County's Sheriff's Major Tony Wooten told DawsonNews.com: 'At this point, we don't suspect foul play. 'There's nothing other than that they got up to go fishing and at that point they haven't been seen since. We've got nothing to show that any foul play was involved.' Good friends: Friends and family said Mason Cox, left, and David Wood, right, would not have run away . At a press . conference today, both mothers reached out to their sons and spoke of their hope to see their safe return. Mason’s mother Leanne Cox said: 'My son . left his cellphone, his wallet, the shirt he was wearing that night — . it’s all in his room. His car is here. He’s just gone.' 'These are strong . kids. They are smart. Something stupid has just happened. Everybody is . here for you. Nothing is going to happen. If anything is wrong, don’t . worry, we’re here to support you. We’re here. 'We don't know what happened. It's like they just disappeared into thin air.' Ethelyn Geiger added: . 'David, Mason, if you can hear this, please call somebody. We’re very . worried about you. We just want to find our boys.' Relatives today posted an update on a Facebook page set up to keep friends and the public up to date with the search. Mr . Cox's brother wrote: 'Divers are going out today... We have been . waiting days for the ice to be break up and melt. Finally the Georgia . Bureau of Investigation and search and rescue team can get their . equipment in to survey the the bottom of lake lanier. 'Please pray for the best outcome, I again thank you all for your efforts and support in the search of my brother Mason Cox and David Wood.' Earlier the family posted a message vowing to hunt down those involved in the disappearance of their loved ones. It read: 'The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is finally involved to find my missing brother and his friend. To those who are ignorant, they did not run away and are not hiding. 'We will find those involved with the disappearance and punish them to the fullest extent their life has to offer.' Speaking a day after their disappearance, David Wood’s mother Ms Geiger told the Gainesville Times: 'David and Mason have been best friends for years. They are good boys. They did what normal 20-year-olds did. 'They went night fishing that morning and were supposed to come back and hang out with us for the day after New Year’s. They didn’t come back. We haven’t seen them since. We don’t know where they are.'",

    "document": "Two brothers who found the remains of the plane flown by their grandfather in the First World War have spent 12 years restoring it to working order. David and Rick Bremner from Milson, Shropshire, have scoured the globe looking for parts to rebuild the Bristol Scout Type-C plane once piloted by their grandfather, Francis Donald Holden Bremner. The pair have spent out over £100,000 since they found three small parts in his shed following his death in 1983 and have finally completed the reconstruction this week. The rebuilt Bristol Scout Type C airfcraft, which was flown between 1914 and 1916 by David and Rick Bremner's grandfather Francis . Their grandfather Francis Donald Holden Bremner in Thasos in 1916 with one of the seven Bristol Scout Type C biplane he flew . Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Donald Holden Bremner (left), in 1915, and his grandson David Bremner (right), 63, who took on the task . Flight Sub Lieutenant Bremner had flown the plane between 1914 and 1918 while serving with the Royal Naval Air Service during the Gallipoli campaign. On his return from battle the war hero had always told his family he would like to see the aircraft take to the skies once again. To honour their late grandfather's wishes David, 63, and Rick, 61, along with friend and amateur pilot Theo Willford, 66, began looking for the other components that would complete the aircraft. Starting with just a joystick, rudder bar and magneto - an electrical generator which uses magnets - found in the shed the trio have travelled the world looking for the rest of the parts - many no longer in existence - including the engine, which was purchased in New Zealand. After a staggering 10,000 hours of building the plane from scratch, this week they put the final touches to the aircraft, which has a wingspan of 24ft and is 20ft in length. It is due to take the skies in spring next year and the trio plan to fly it over the River Somme on July 1, 2016, marking exactly 100 years since the fateful day in 1916 when almost 20,000 British soldiers lost their lives in France. Rick Bremner (left), friend Theo Willford (centre) and David Bremner (right) spent 12 years rebuilding the First World War fighter plane . Theo Willford lays out the wing structure during its restoration (left) and the grip of the plane's joystick which had to be repaired (right) Some of the plane's original parts, including the stick, rubber and magneto (left), which David (right) found after his grandfather's death . The trio are celebrating this week after completing the restoration of the plane and plan to take it to the skies for the first time in spring . It will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. David, who works as a mechanical engineer and is chairman of the British Microlight Aircraft Association, said he believed his grandfather would be proud. He said: 'We grew up less than 10 miles from my grandfather in Kent so we heard all his war stories. 'Although he talked about flying a lot he had never mentioned keeping these parts before. 'When we found them we knew they belonged to his favourite plane because the magneto was made by Bosch, the German company. 'Back in those days it was very hard to get German parts obviously, but my grandfather had told us the story of how he traded a few bombs and some food to a French base in return for the Bosch magneto. 'So these parts came from that plane and it would make sense that he would keep hold of them because it was his favourite aircraft he had flown. 'He said one day he would like to see it fly again over British skies.' The brother's have spent over £10,000 on the plane and wanted to rebuilt it as a tribute to their grandfather who died in 1983 . The aircraft will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. David is pictured with his wife Susan Bremner and the plane, which he says his grandfather would have been 'proud' of . These three pieces of the plane were discovered when David and his father, Ian, 91, were clearing out Francis' workshop, following his death in 1983. They quickly realised they had found the part which provides a spark for the engine, from the pilot's beloved No.1264 aircraft. But it was not until Mr Willford, a fellow amateur pilot, encouraged the family to start rebuilding the plane that the project came about. In 2002, the trio began researching where they could find appropriate parts to start rebuilding the plane before work began in 2010. David, a grandfather-of-two, added: 'We had the parts for years and had the idea in the back of our minds that one day we would try to rebuild the plane. 'But it was Theo who actually got us to make a start. 'We started researching what the plane would look like and because the parts don't exist anymore we had to plan what replacements we could still get now. 'The three original bits we had only probably made up about two per cent of the whole thing, so there was so much left to do. 'The only thing we didn't make ourselves was the engine, which we got from a New Zealand-based company and it's is an actual 1917 engine in a beautiful condition. One of the Bristol Scouts crashed on the island of Imbros in Turkey, which is now officially known as Gökçeada, in March 1916 . 'The aircraft is pretty much finished now apart from the petrol tank and the fabric covering the fuselage. 'Rick and I live in Shropshire but Theo lives in Dorset, so we took small things down to him and then brought them back in a trailer when he was working on it. 'I think our grandfather would be proud of us re-building his favourite plane, but he'd probably say we've spent far too much time and money on it as well.' Sub-lieutenant Holden, nicknamed 'Bunnie' because he was always twitching his nose, was in active service between, throughout the whole of the First World War. After the war he worked as a patents engineer in Brasted, Kent and lived with his wife Vivyen, and two sons, Christopher, and Ian - Rick and David's father. During 1916, Officer Holden had been stationed on the islands of Imbros and Thasos in the Aegean Sea as part of the Royal Naval Air Service, and flew seven Bristol Scout Type-C planes. His favourite plane of the seven had Serial No. 1264 and he kept three small parts of that aircraft in his workshop until he died aged 89. Rick, a builder and father-of-two from Tenbury Wells, added: 'It's been a huge privilege to be part of this project. It's just fantastic. 'We all just wish my grandfather was here to answer a lot of questions we have about details of the plane, because he could have told us straight away. 'We have old photos of what the plane should look like, but when you try to zoom in to look a specific details, it's too grainy to make out. 'But fortunately we got there in the end - its been a long old labour of love but it's been worth it. 'I think its a fitting tribute to my grandad and other British pilots who battled so valiantly for us during the Great War.' Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Bremner, nicknamed 'Bunnie' can be seen in the seat of the Bristol Scout on Thasos, Greece, in June 1916 . This is the map that Francis Bremner used to fly 89 miles across water from Imbors to Thasos. Most if it was out of sight with no radio and an unreliable compass . The Bristol Scout was a single-engine, single-seat fighter intended to supply ground commanders with an advantageous 'eye in the sky'. The initial prototype, Scout A, was unveiled in 1913 with a top speed of 100 miles per hour, a service ceiling of 14,000 feet and an endurance of 2.5 hours. Its design was regarded as very streamlined and consisted of a well-contoured fuselage with the single rotary piston engine set to the front and a conventional tail to the rear. The engine powered a two-bladed wooden propeller and the open air cockpit was held just under and aft of the upper wing assembly with generally adequate views. The Scout B was established as an early militarised form and led to the development of the Scout C – which was the one flown by the Bremner's grandfather. Type C aircraft was first ordered by the British government on November 5, 1914, in a 12 aircraft production batch for the Royal Flying Corps. In was later commissioned by the competing Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in a 24-aircraft batch and its first combat was in February 1915. It was armed with a standardised mounting and a 7.7mm Lewis machine gun along the left side of the fuselage away from the spinning propeller arc. Some were also finished with their guns fielded across the upper wing assembly. Its targets ranged from enemy aircraft (patrol, escort, interception), bombers, observation balloons, ground-based 'targets of opportunity' and even Zeppelins, which regularly patrolled airspaces. The C type Scout was followed by Scout D in November 1915, when 210 aircraft were produced. Source: Military Factory .",

    "document": "Editor's note: Thomas Maier is the author of \"The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings,\" (Basic Books), which was the basis of a Warner Bros. video documentary released in November. He is a reporter for Newsday. Thomas Maier says Ted Kennedy's immigrant heritage helped drive his advocacy of a more open America. (CNN) -- With a sign from Dunganstown, Ireland, hanging in his U.S. Capitol office, a reminder of the famine-ravished farm where his ancestors began, Sen. Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy always seemed to understand that the Kennedys were perhaps America's greatest immigrant story -- overcoming religious, ethnic and cultural barriers to reach once unimaginable heights. \"My brother Jack wrote 'A Nation of Immigrants' in 1958, and his words ring true as clearly today as they did half a century ago,\" said Ted early last year, a few months before he was struck with a malignant brain tumor that claimed his life Tuesday. \"I'm constantly reminded of my immigrant heritage.\" Indeed, the Kennedys' vision of \"A Nation of Immigrants\" -- which Ted championed throughout his public career -- dramatically transformed today's America, opening the door for millions of new citizens and paving the way for Barack Obama's presidency. It is the Kennedys' most lasting legacy. John F. Kennedy's idealistic belief in America's dream of opportunity for all was clearly stated in \"A Nation of Immigrants,\" which reflected so much of his family's story as Irish Catholic immigrants. The essence of this little known, little-studied book became the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, which ended the discriminatory preference given to white Europeans and opened the door to millions from Latin America, Asia, Africa and around the world. First proposed by President Kennedy in July 1963, a few months before his assassination, the bill was passed in his memory, pushed by his two brothers in the U.S. Senate and signed by President Lyndon Johnson beneath the Statue of Liberty. Ted was particularly proud of its passage and referred to it often in public. No law in our lifetime has done more to change the demographics of modern America. Many historians routinely ignore, or give only a passing nod, to the underlying forces of ethnicity and religion that so often influenced the Kennedy family's actions and outlook. Often their years in power were lionized as \"Camelot\" by the press. But as Ted Kennedy realized, a comparison to British royalty hardly seemed proper for the great-grandson of an Irish migrant worker who fled from a Dunganstown, County Wexford, farm during the Great Famine. That Dunganstown sign in Ted's office was a reminder of the Kennedys' sense of their own immigrant heritage, their epic encounters with religious bigotry, and how the complex dynamics of their family life reflected the Irish Catholic experience in America. From his grandfather, former Boston Mayor John F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, young Ted heard of the great wave of Irish immigrants to America that included their family. And in the 1990s, the efforts of Ted and his sister, U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, to bring peace to their ancestral homeland seemed to reflect their deeper sense of being Irish, of being Catholic and of being members of a family coming from an often oppressed immigrant minority. Ted went back to Ireland many times, including to the old Kennedy homestead in Dunganstown. The culmination of this Kennedy's immigrant legacy was most apparent by the 2008 presidential campaign, which offered many reminders for Ted Kennedy of the barriers his brother faced in 1960, becoming the first U.S. president from a minority background. Most notably, Obama, the U.S. senator from Illinois, possessed a style and dignity particularly reminiscent of the Kennedy era. At a key moment in the primary campaign, Ted Kennedy publicly supported Obama who, in turn, said the Kennedy family always stood for \"what is best about America.\" Obama's campaign faced many tests similar to those that John Kennedy endured in 1960 as the first and only Roman Catholic elected to the presidency. As a minority, born to black and white parents, Obama had to overcome code words and subtle biases historically applied to African-Americans. Like Catholic hard-liners who complained that Kennedy wasn't \"Catholic enough\" in 1960, Obama was sometimes criticized within the black community for not seeming \"black enough\" in 2008. And yet when the media made it seem Obama had been attacked for his minority status, African-Americans rallied to his support, just as Catholics did in 1960 for Kennedy. Ted Kennedy's dramatic embrace of Obama's candidacy carried a powerful symbolism, one of the last significant acts of his distinguished career before he fell ill. From the broadest vantage, the Kennedy story reminds us of the glories and the limits of America's melting pot and those histories that paint people from minority groups in familiar \"just like us\" tones. We gain a better grasp of the Kennedys' appeal beyond Irish Catholics -- to countless other immigrant and minority groups who share a dream of ascendancy in America. In this context, our understanding of the Kennedys becomes richer, more complex and of greater historical significance to what John Kennedy called a nation of immigrants. It recalls how far we've progressed as a country since the 1960 election, and yet how many barriers still remain today. No one understood that better than Ted Kennedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Maier.",

Attack: One-time TV dad of the year Keith Preddie could face jail after he admitted attacking his wife . A former television dad of the year is facing jail after he admitted attacking his wife in a row over Christmas presents. Michael Jackson impersonator and father of three Keith Preddie, 44, threw a clothes horse and a plastic step at his wife Emma before pinning her to a sofa at their home in Croydon last December. Preddie, who was awarded the title of Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010, gave a long pause before breaking down in tears as he admitted assault by beating at Croydon Magistrates' Court today. Chairman of the Bench Jackie Hamblin warned Preddie he could face a spell behind bars as she adjourned the hearing for sentence next month. The performer, who wore a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie, appeared tearful throughout the hearing and was supported in court by around 15 well-wishers. Preddie was Britain's original Michael Jackson impersonator, first taking on the role of the King of Pop in 1986 and going on to perform his routine on stage and screen. He has also worked for the Family Centre in New Addington, which offers support services for local families, for the past decade. It was his work to set up an It's Time For Dad's support group at the centre that saw him crowned Britain's Best Dad by GMTV three years ago. The court heard details of Preddie's assault on his wife at the family home in Croydon, footage of which was captured on a CCTV camera at the house. Prosecutor Louise Thomas told the court how a row flared on the morning of December 18 last year after Preddie marched in to the back room of the family home where his wife was wrapping Christmas presents. 'Mr Preddie entered the room and asked her if there were any presents left over that he could give his mother,' she said. 'Mrs Preddie replied she had already given his mother a present. 'At that point Mr Preddie became angry, he shouted that he had been to a lot of shops to get a present for his mother and he got very stressed during the day looking for one.' Ms Thomas told magistrates how Mrs Preddie warned her husband she would only speak to him if he calmed down. But his anger only worsened. 'Suddenly he grabbed a washing frame which had clothing on it and he threw it at her. It landed about a foot away from her,' she said. Tears: Preddie, who has been a Michael Jackson impersonator for almost 30 years, broke down in court as he admitted assault by beating before magistrates in Croydon today . 'At that point she told him he had better calm down and grow up so he left the room. 'After a short time he re-entered the room and started shouting again. He then threw a plastic step at Mrs Preddie hitting her on her left arm,' the prosecutor said. The court was told how Mrs Preddie told her husband to get out of the room. Ms Thomas said: 'At that point she walked straight up to him and then she suddenly found herself pinned down by both arms. 'Each of the defendant's hands holding each arm. She was pinned down lying against the sofa. She shouted \"Get off me, leave me alone\". 'He then let go and she left the room. The argument caused such a commotion that it woke up their daughter,' she said. Notoriety: Preddie appeared on an episode of Come Dine With Me and was named Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010 . Ms Thomas told how Mrs Preddie contacted police the following day, having already spoken to a domestic violence shelter. She added: 'On the morning of December 20 she told Mr Preddie that she had called the police and he said he knew what he had done was wrong and apologised.' After the hearing Ms Thomas explained that CCTV footage of the assault obtained by police had come . from a camera inside the house. No explanation was given as to why there . was a camera present. She also said pictures taken by Ms Preddie showed bruising to her left arm. Adjourning the hearing for sentence on April 11, Ms Hamblin said: 'The report that we will request is an all options report. That could include custody. 'We note that this offence was committed in a domestic setting and had an effect on your daughter, who was in the house. 'We found greater harm because of the sustained nature of the attack.' Preddie has appeared on an episode of the Channel 4 reality show Come Dine With Me, which saw him annoying his fellow contestants by repeatedly parroting Jacko's 'Shamone' catchphrase. He later released a pop single named Shamone, which entered the music charts in Germany. Preddie was bailed to return to the court on April 11 for sentence, when the court will also hear an application for costs and a restraining order. He was ordered not to contact his ex-wife and will only be allowed back to his old family home while accompanied by police to collect his belongings.",

A glamorous Hollywood publicist who was gunned down as she drove home from a movie premiere died from a shot to the heart, her autopsy has revealed. Ronni Chasen, 64, was driving home from a showing of Burlesque when her Mercedes-Benz came under attack on Sunset Boulevard by a gunman with a stolen policeman's pistol on November 16. She was hit four times, the report said, including 'the most rapidly fatal' shot, which pierced her heart, then passed through the right-side pulmonary vein and the right lung. A toxicology test found no signs of alcohol or drugs in her system. The main suspect in the case, Harold Smith, committed suicide in the . lobby of a Hollywood apartment building when police approached him more . than three weeks after the slaying to question him. Initially, rumours swirled around Hollywood that Ms Chasen had been targeted in a professional hit. But police later claimed the crime scene was consistent with an attempted robbery or road rage. Ms Chasen’s car was found with its window cracked open a few inches. Police believe that Smith, a 43-year-old ex-convict, shot Ms Chasen. He shot himself dead on December 1 in a Santa Monica apartment building after being confronted by officers. The report revealed that the gun, . which was used in both shootings, was a revolver stolen from a police . officer during a burglary in the San Fernando Valley. Final hours: The evening before her brutal murder, Chasen, far right, arrived on the red carpet at the Burlesque premiere to support a client . Smash: Chasen was still breathing immediately after the crash, according to the first witnesses to reach her . Removed: Ms Chasen's damaged Mercedes Benz was towed away from Sunset Boulevard . Suspect: Harold Smith had been convicted for weapons and drugs charges . It is unclear what department that officer works for and when the weapon was stolen. The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that Ms Chasen had been killed in a professional hit. It . said that a professional would likely have used a more powerful weapon . and the hit would have been in a more remote location. The gunman also hit Ms Chasen in the shoulder and chest, rather than in a tight pattern. Ms Chasen received no death threats, was involved in no legal battles and seemed to live a ‘normal life’. The veteran publicist was driving her Mercedes Benz just after midnight on November 16 when she was shot in the chest, leading her car to smash into a light pole. Ms Chasen had just attended the premiere and after-party for the new movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera. She lived in Westwood, some 10 miles away, and may have been driving home when the attack occurred. The publicist ran her own public relations and marketing firm, Chasen & Co and was well known in the industry. She had worked as a publicist since 1973 with high-profile films on her resume like 1989's Driving Miss Daisy and 1994's Lolita. Grim: The LA county coroner removes Smith's body. Police confirmed the shooting was suicide using CCTV tapes . Apartment: Smith refused to surrender to officers and then pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head . She also did work for the Cocoon and Rocky franchises as well as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. She was named senior vice president of worldwide publicity at MGM in 1993. MGM . executive Ashley Boone called Ms Chasen, 'One of the most respected . publicity executives in the business' with 'strength and expertise in . developing, positioning and executing productive motion picture . campaigns'.",

    "document": "A congressman and his wife have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes by adopting them into their own family. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin told NewsOK that he was hesitant at first to expand his brood of three to five, but his wife convinced him otherwise. Now, little Ivy and Lynette - who were born into 'kind of a bad situation' - are fully integrated into the Mullin family and they 'could not be happier,' says the congressman. Happy family: Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin and his wife Christie have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes (bottom right) by adopting them into their own family . Grinning girls: Ivy (left) and Lynette (right) were living with distant, elderly relations of Mrs Mullin, in separate homes, before they were adopted on August 21 . Before the adoption was approved on August 21, the blonde twins were living with distant relations of Mr Mullin's wife Christie, in separate but 'very loving' homes. But the relatives, a grandmother and great aunt, had told Mrs Mullin that they hoped they'd live long enough to see the girls graduate. The congressman's wife approached him several times about adopting the girls, but he told her it was a huge time commitment, and they already had their hands full with two sons, nine and eight, and a five-year-old girl. He suggested he write a check, telling her 'it's easier sometimes to give money than it is to give time.' Seeking guidance: The congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, said: '[God] opened our hearts to the idea of adoption' (pictured with wife Christie, sons Jim and Andrew, and daughter Larra) But then Mrs Mullin pulled what her husband calls the 'trump card'. She asked him: 'Would you pray about it?' 'How do you pray about that?' said Congressman Mullin at a town meeting in Henryetta, Oklahoma, last week. Politician parent: Republican Markwayne Mullin, 36, is the U.S. Representative for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district . 'I mean, really. \"Hey Lord, would you please, please make her heart as selfish as mine\"?' So instead he prayed that God would change his own mind, 'And man did He ever,' he says. The Congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, told TheHill: 'Our family prayed for God's will and He opened our hearts to the idea of adoption. 'We were unsure about whether, at this time, we could handle the extra responsibility,' he added. 'But God's timing is always perfect.' Now the congressman - who is part of the Cherokee nation, just like his twin girls - says Lynette and Ivy have taught him more than he ever expected. 'People say, \"Man, you're going to be . such a blessing to those girls,\"' he said at the town meeting. 'And I'm going to tell you right now - if you're someone . who's thinking about adoption - you're going to be blessed more by them . than you will ever be a blessing to them.' As for the girls themselves, they have apparently been doing well since being reunited. 'If you talk to anybody, they say twins . need to be together. The bond between them is just amazing,' said Congressman Mullin. 'They can . have a conversation with each other for hours and nobody else can . understand it,' he added. Loving couple: Congressman Mullin has been married to his high school sweetheart Christie for 16 years .

    "document": "(CNN) -- Imagine a smoke-filled jazz club, dark and crowded. The sounds of a trumpet solo echo on stage, while a piano, bass and drums pound out a finger-snapping groove. You can almost smell the cigarette smoke, taste the cheap booze being served. This is Berlin, 1939 -- the eve of World War II. These are the Hot Time Swingers, the imagined jazz band at the center of Esi Edugyan's \"Half-Blood Blues.\" The novel was a finalist for Britain's prestigious Man Booker prize in 2011 and reaches U.S. bookstores this week. The story is told through the eyes of the Swingers' bass player, Sid Griffiths, in alternating takes between events in Paris and Berlin in 1939 and Baltimore and Berlin in 1992. The novel captures the end of the jazz age in Germany perfectly in the characters' staccato slang, sounding much like jazz music imagined as dialogue. Offstage, the story captures the paranoia and fear of the days leading up to the start of the war, and the racial tension of the time period. Sid narrates, but the band's brilliant young trumpet player, Hieronymus \"Hiero\" Falk, is the linchpin of the story, a German who happens to be black. Hiero's prodigy-like talent brings the band success, love and rivalries among its members. After being banned by the Nazis as \"degenerate\" music, the Swingers escape to Paris, where they meet Louis Armstrong. But then war breaks out, and the Gestapo arrests Hiero in a cafÃ©. He is never heard from again. Jump ahead 50 years. Falk has become a cult hero among jazz fans. He's now the subject of a documentary film. Sid and the only other surviving band member, Chip Jones, are invited to the film's premiere in Berlin. As they return to celebrate their long-lost friend, Sid, the only witness to Hiero's disappearance, is forced to reveal a decades-old secret. \"Half-Blood Blues\" is the second novel from Edugyan, an author with a bit of a globe-hopping past. She was born and raised in Canada, the daughter of immigrant parents from Ghana. She has studied and lived in the United States and across Europe, including stops in Iceland, Spain and Germany. Now married and mother to an infant daughter, Edugyan lives in Victoria, British Columbia. CNN recently asked her about the novel in a phone interview and via e-mail. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark behind your book? Edugyan: I was living in Germany at the time, acutely aware of my difference -- being a black woman from Canada. At the same time I'd been reading about the so-called \"Rhineland Bastards\" -- the half-black children of France's colonial soldiers from Africa stationed in the Rhineland after the close of the first World War. I began imagining their lives in Germany, as both outsiders and insiders, and this naturally led to my wondering what must have happened to them during the 1930s, with the rise of Nazism. This is where my interest in the novel came from. But the book itself more rightly begins with Sid's voice, his character, the perplexing problems of loyalty and betrayal in any artistic life. CNN: You really captured the feel, the language and the tone of the late 1930s European jazz scene. Did you research this period extensively before you started writing? Edugyan: Thank you, that's kind of you to say. I researched assiduously, both before and during the writing, to capture the feel of that world. But Sid's voice is so very particular to Sid himself that I would never want it to stand in as some sort of \"representative\" voice from that time. It's an approximation of the kind of hybrid language he and his band mates were speaking at the time. But it's important to remember, too, that Sid is a man straddling two eras -- 1930s Europe and 1990s Baltimore -- and the shifts in his rhythms, diction, syntax hopefully capture some of that flavor. CNN: I pictured you listening to a lot of jazz from this time period while you were writing. Did you and were there any jazz artists in particular that inspired you? Edugyan: It's interesting to hear you say so. The music was my constant companion, even more than books. Not only as a way to lead me back into the novel after each break but also as a kind of consolation. There was a strength and faith and promise in it that I think I needed at the time. What's fascinating to me now is to think back on who I was listening to at various points in the novel and read the book with that in mind. Not only the language itself, but the speed and emotion under the prose finds a corollary in the music. Or so it seems to me in retrospect. Among the artists I listened to most often were Sidney Bechet, Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong. CNN: Your novel focuses on the Nazi persecution of the Afro-German community. What drew you to this little known chapter of pre-World War II history? Edugyan: As the Canadian-born daughter of Ghanaian immigrants, I grew up between worlds, in a sense, aware both of my differences and kinships. Loyalties were always mixed, and the world inside the walls of my home was significantly different from the world beyond it. I did my graduate work at Johns Hopkins, living in Baltimore for a short time, which reinforced this complicated sense of identity. And in the years since, I lived on and off in Europe, where, as ever, I had periods of feeling profoundly at home and periods of total estrangement. I think that sense of uprootedness, that quiet seeking after identity and self, lies at the heart of this novel. ... In the writing itself, you're not thinking about such things. You just know that there's a story there, one you want told. And you run with it. CNN: While Sid narrates the novel, this really felt like Hiero's story to me. He's such a compelling character but remains something of an enigma. I assume this was by design? Edugyan: Absolutely. That unknowability lies at the core of the novel. It seemed it would have been an act of extraordinary presumption to take Hiero's voice, to speak for him, to fill that silence. And, too, a way of diminishing the sadness of what he (and his real-life counterparts) suffered. CNN: You come from such an interesting background, the child of Ghanaian Ã©migrÃ© parents, born and raised in Canada. You've studied in a number of countries, including the U.S. and Europe. You now live in British Columbia. How has all that world travel influenced you as an artist and a person? Edugyan: ... There can be something liberating ... for the fiction writer who finds herself caught between worlds. An opportunity to observe and inhabit the skins of others. I know, for myself, that all of that traveling has impacted the kinds of stories I am drawn to. CNN: You're also the mother of a young child. Has that changed your approach to writing? Edugyan: Oh, it's still so early to tell -- our daughter is only 6 months old. But that, too, is turning out to be a different kind of journey. CNN: What's next for you? Edugyan: I find myself staring out the windows an awful lot these days, dreaming up the next book. But our daughter fills up the immediate hours of the day.

Claire Danes may have scooped the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her role in Homeland at this years 65th Primetime Emmys, but it was her hair that caused the biggest storm when she stepped onto the red carpet. With her usually shoulder length locks seemingly chopped into a soft bob, the 34-year-old actress revealed to E! read carpet presenter Ryan Seacrest that her crop was in fact fake. Rather than committing to a haircut, the actress had her hair carefully styled into a ‘fob’, or faux bob, and here Femail shows you how to copy this chic style. Keep your hair on! Homeland's Claire Danes pulls hair fake-out with 'faux bob' when she hit the red carpet at the 65th Primetime Emmys on Monday .

Errol said of Claire’s red carpet look: ‘The bob is a classic – it's the fast track to elegant and a great way to show off high gloss healthy locks, it's age versatile and there's an interpretation that works for all face shapes and hair colours. ‘It's an iconic look and will always work for the timeless glamour we like to see on the red carpet. I love that Claire Danes rocked the fake.’ Errol says that the right tools and preparation are essential for Femail readers hoping to create the perfect ‘fob’ Where you are after a 'fob' or a full-on bob, Errol says make sure you get the right style for you. 'Ask what length overall and type of fringe or not will suit your face . shape, age and lifestyle. 'A longer version with soft fringe will be . easier to maintain and easier to wear. Do ask also about colour . choices, particularly on blonde tones, as they need to match skin tones . which change with age, just to ensure they flatter and don't appear . harsh. 'Ask about the amount of layers cut into a bob – too many results . in a loss of shape and the hair kicks OUT instead of IN which is the . signature look of a bob. 'Finally, the the minimum length of a bob I . feel for best flattering features should be to the jaw line, anything . above is quite difficult to pull off and isn't for everyone' He says: 'After a barrel brush blow dry to really smooth out all of the hair, use pins to literally mould the hair and push it underneath itself, rolled almost to the desired bob length. ‘Faking on longer hair in this way creates a natural vintage movement with the thickness of the hair once it's doubled up on itself. Use Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream to mould (use on wet hair before the blow dry) and Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray to set without stiffness.' 'A smooth, healthy, high shine finish is the key to all interpretations of the bob, so product preparation and the right styling tools are essential. Build in moisture before a barrel brush blow dry with Morocanoil Original Treatment applied from mid length to ends. 'Once dry, finish with a heated styling tool that locks in moisture and delivers shine. My Treat&Style has built in Keratin Capsules to infuse a shot of the hair's naturally produced protein, visible on the finish. Use a non-sticky spray to finish that allows movement.'

She also stunned on the red carpet, wearing an Armani Privé couture lace gown with a neckline slashed down to the navel, paired with subtle Neil Lane jewellery and Christian Louboutin shoes. However some critics thought the actress looked too skinny, drawing attention to her jutting collar bones and flat chest. Claire may have faked hers, but there was no doubt that bobs were as on trend as pale pastel dresses on the red carpet this year. Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery's bob was sleek and side-parted, while Giuliana Rancic added edge to her chic bob with a bias cut and Jane Krakowski softened hers with layers and a sweeping fringe.

    "document": "(CNN) -- Real Madrid head coach Jose Mourinho claims it was in referee Paradas Romero's \"nature\" to send him to the stands during Wednesday's 5-1 Copa del Rey win over Real Murcia. Mourinho was protesting a 37th-minute yellow card given to Mali midfielder Mahamadou Diarra when Romero adjudged him to have overstepped the mark and banished him from the touchline. The Portuguese boss -- whose team advanced beyond the last-32 stage of Spain's premier cup competition for the first time in three years -- highlighted Romero's past record of handing out yellow cards as the reason behind his dismissal. The former Inter Milan coach stopped short of openly criticizing the match officials, and admitted he would not able to do a better job than Romero. The worst referee decisions in football? \"I cannot say he was a bad referee,\" Mourinho told Los Blancos' official website. \"I would make a terrible referee. \"[But] just look at this referee's statistics. It is in his nature. I'm not saying he is good or bad. I am not one to judge him, but I do usually analyze referee statistics. \"This one has officiated about 50 matches in the Spanish league and has shown more than 250 yellow cards, an average of more than six per match. He booked 10 players in his last match.\" However, Spanish press reported that Romero claimed Mourinho abused him after being booked for protesting, forcing him to send the coach to the stands. Should referees be relegated too? \"In the 37th minute, the manager Jose Mario dos Santos Mourinho Felix was given a yellow card for the following reason: raising his arms in the air, complaining about a decision I made,\" Romero reportedly wrote in his after-match summary. \"Once he was given the yellow card, he faced me and said, 'Go to hell.' \" Real's win was emphatic, as goals from Esteban Granero, Gonzalo Higuain, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso ensured they avoided the humiliation of last year when they suffered a 4-1 aggregate loss to third-tier team Alcoron. Mourinho's men are currently sitting top of the Spanish first division, a point clear of arch-rivals Barcelona after 10 matches. Meanwhile, the first \"Clasico\" clash between the two Spanish heavyweights this season will be played on a Monday due to the Catalan elections taking place the day before on November 28. Barca will host Real with kickoff scheduled for 9 p.m. local time (2000 GMT, 1500 ET). \"This is due to the 13th round coinciding with the elections for the parliament of Catalonia and the security problems that would create,\" read a statement on Real's website on Thursday.",

    "document": "By . Laura Clark . PUBLISHED: . 20:43 EST, 6 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 7 December 2012 . Personal statements on university application forms should be scrapped because they are unfair to state school pupils, a study claimed today. The Sutton Trust education charity found state pupils are more likely to make writing errors and to struggle to draw on suitable work experience. Private school pupils are likelier to use ‘appropriate’ language in the 600-word texts and to describe prestigious job placements or other activities. Unfair: State school pupils were more likely to make errors in their personal statements, the study found . Half a million of the essays are penned every year by applicants seeking to sell themselves to their preferred universities. One private school pupil cited six high-status work placements including a stint on the trading floor of a top firm of stockbrokers and ‘most recently managing a small gastro pub’. In contrast, a state school pupil had written that ‘in the final GCSE year there was an opportunity for a group of us to manage the school lockers’. The study also warned of growing evidence that personal statements are ‘for sale’ and teenagers are paying up to £350 for statements written for them by graduates. The research, commissioned by the Sutton Trust education charity, called for the personal statement section of the UCAS application form to be radically overhauled to prevent pupils ‘exploiting school type advantages’. It said there was anecdotal evidence some pupils received so much help the statement could not be seen as their ‘own work’. Competition: More than half a million personal statements are penned every year by applicants eager to sell themselves to their chosen university . Applicants should be only be able to list a limited number of experiences - perhaps as few as one, the report said. Rather than allowing a ‘free response’, UCAS should consider inviting applicants to answer a specific question. Instead of simply listing their previous achievements, applicants should be asked to state which attributes they would bring to a course or university. Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: ‘Personal statements should be more than an excuse to highlight past advantages. ‘Applicants should outline how they might contribute to campus life, and universities should make it clear that applicants are not penalised for lacking opportunities in the past due to family circumstances.’ The study, by Dr Steven Jones, of Manchester University, analysed 309 personal statements written by teenagers with three Bs at A-levels who were applying to the same department of an elite university. He found that state school applicants appeared to receive less help in composing their statements and made three times more grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. When discussing work experience, they were more likely to mention Saturday jobs such as waitressing at KFC or stacking shelves at Aldi rather than prestigious placements. University applicants should be allowed to outline how they might contribute to campus life, the study said . One private school applicant had talked of shadowing the Indian Ambassador to the United Nations. Privately-educated pupils were also more likely to cite working in family businesses. And when it came to listing hobbies and interests, the activities described by state school students tended to ‘carry little weight in the admissions process’, the study said. It highlighted examples of private school applicants citing cordon bleu cookery courses at Anton Mosimann’s school and skiing seasons at Meribel. But one state school applicant had written about following Manchester United, adding: ‘I regularly watch Match of the Day and I enjoy the diversity of the Champions League.’ Seventy per cent of the privately-educated applicants in the study ended up being accepted by an elite university, against just 50 per cent from comprehensives and colleges. The report called for state schools to give pupils better advice and guidance in drawing up their statements. It added: ‘UCAS should consider whether the personal statement, in its current form, is an appropriate and fair indicator of applicants’ potential.’ And it said: ‘A fairer structure for the personal statement might be one that allows one activity only to be listed.’ UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook, said: ‘I have every confidence in the professionalism of admissions officers - they are highly experienced in recognising social factors in the content of personal statements. ‘The personal statement is one of a number of pieces of evidence that admissions staff look at when assessing an applicant’s potential to succeed in higher education.’",

    "document": "(CNN) -- A piece of ice four times the size of Manhattan island has broken away from an ice shelf in Greenland, according to scientists in the U.S. The 260 square-kilometer (100 square miles) ice island separated from the Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland early on Thursday, researchers based at the University of Delaware said. The ice island, which is about half the height of the Empire State Building, is the biggest piece of ice to break away from the Arctic icecap since 1962 and amounts to a quarter of the Petermann 70-kilometer floating ice shelf, according to research leader Andreas Muenchow. \"The freshwater stored in this ice island could keep the Delaware or Hudson rivers flowing for more than two years. It could also keep all U.S. public tap water flowing for 120 days,\" Muenchow said. Muenchow's team is studying ice in the Nares Strait separating Greenland from Canada, about 1,000 kilometers south of the North Pole. Satellite data from NASA's MODIS-Aqua satellite revealed the initial rupture which was confirmed within hours by Trudy Wohlleben of the Canadian Ice Service, according to the University of Delaware website. Muenchow said the island could block the Nares Strait as it drifts south, or break into smaller islands and continue towards the open waters of the Atlantic. \"In Nares Strait, the ice island will encounter real islands that are all much smaller in size,\" he said. \"The newly born ice island may become land-fast, block the channel, or it may break into smaller pieces as it is propelled south by the prevailing ocean currents. From there, it will likely follow along the coasts of Baffin Island and Labrador, to reach the Atlantic within the next two years.\" Environmentalists say ice melt is being caused by global warming with Arctic temperatures in the 1990s reaching their warmest level of any decade in at least 2,000 years, according to a study published in 2009. Current trends could see the Arctic Ocean become ice free in summer months within decades, researchers predict.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Defending champion Serena Williams joined her sister Venus in the last 16 at Wimbledon on Saturday, but French Open runner-up Francesca Schiavone suffered a shock defeat. Williams, seeded seventh in only her second tournament since last year's victory in London, had few problems in dispatching Russia's Maria Kirilenko 6-3 6-2 to set up a fourth-round clash with 2007 runner-up Marion Bartoli. \"Every match is getting better, my serve is getting better, just getting the rhythm that I've been missing. It's great,\" said the American, a four-time winner of the grass-court grand slam event. \"I just want to enjoy myself and stay focused. Bartoli is really good. She won in Eastbourne, she's doing great, so it'll be a good match.\" Can the Williams sisters triumph after a troubled year? The 29-year-old, making her comeback after complications with a foot injury, has won both their previous encounters. Ninth seed Bartoli, beaten by Venus in the 2007 final, battled her way into the fourth round with a 5-7 6-4 9-7 win over Italian No. 21 Flavia Pennetta in just over three hours. The Frenchwoman, who won her first grass title the week before Wimbledon, fought back after sending her coach and father Walter to the stands along with her mother following her first-set reverse. \"I saw them after the match and they understood completely. It was not against them. It was just that we played a very long first set, and I was exhausted and I was tired and I was feeling worse and worse,\" the 26-year-old said in quotes reported by AFP. \"I needed to get that frustration out, so I showed it that way. I could have broken a racquet. I normally never act like that. I felt at this point I had to get all this frustration out and start again.\" Schiavone was also involved in an epic match against unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek, which resumed at one set all after being halted by rain on Friday. The Italian sixth seed ended up losing 3-6 6-4 11-9 in three hours and 41 minutes against a player who also reached the fourth round as a 16-year-old in 2007 but hasn't got past the first stage since then. Schiavone, who won her first grand slam at the 2010 French Open, has only once progressed past the third round, reaching the quarterfinals two years ago. The world No. 80 has a great chance of making the quarterfinals as she next faces 20-year-old Russian left-hander Ksenia Pervak, who knocked out 11th seed Andrea Petkovic on Friday to continue her promising debut appearance. World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki remains on course for her first grand slam title after beating Australian 27th seed Jarmila Gajdosova 6-3 6-2. The 20-year-old Dane will next play Slovakian 24th seed Dominika Cibulkova, who reached the fourth round for the first time with a 6-4 1-6 6-3 win over German No. 16 Julia Gorges. Wozniacki could face fifth seed Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals after the 2004 champion progressed with a 6-2 6-3 win over Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic. The Russian will begin the second week of the tournament with a clash against Peng Shuai, the only Chinese player left in the draw. Peng, seeded 20th, will be hoping to repeat compatriot Li Na's victory over Sharapova at the French Open after earning her place with a 6-2 7-6 (7-5) victory over Hungary's Melinda Czink. Sabine Lisicki, who eliminated Roland Garros winner Li in the second round, continued her progress with a 6-4 6-2 win over Japan's Misaki Doi. The German will next play world No. 81 Petra Cetkovska, who eliminated Serbian 18th seed Ana Ivanovic. The winner of that match will next face Serena Williams or Bartoli. Cetkovska, who has never before made it past the first round at Wimbledon, won 6-2 7-6 (7-0) against the former world No. 1 and 2008 French Open champion. The rest of the last-16 draw sees five-time champion Venus Williams face 2010 semifinalist Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria, while fourth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus plays Russia's Nadia Petrova and Czech eighth seed Petra Kvitova takes on Belgian No. 18 Yanina Wickmayer.",

    "document": "A top-secret weapon being developed by the US military was destroyed four seconds after its launch from a test range in Alaska early on Monday after controllers detected a problem with the system, the Pentagon said. The Advanced Hypersonic Weapon is part of a program to create a missile that will destroy targets anywhere on Earth within hours - traveling at speeds in excess of 3,500 miles-an-hour or Mach 5. The mission was aborted to ensure public safety, and no one was injured in the incident, which occurred shortly after 4 am EDT at the Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska, said Maureen Schumann, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Defense Department. 'We had to terminate,' Schumann said. 'The weapon exploded during takeoff and fell back down in the range complex,' she added. The incident caused an undetermined amount of damage to the launch facility 25 miles from the city of Kodiak, Schumann said. Scroll down for video . Detonation: The moment the weapon exploded is captured by Scott Wight and shows the horizon from Cape Greville in Chiniak, Alaska . Officials said that the weapon system was not carrying a warhead when it was aborted. The rocket carrying the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon was terminated near a pad of the Kodiak Launch Complex on Kodiak Island shortly after liftoff, spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said. After an anomaly was detected, testers made the decision to destroy the rocket to ensure public safety, Schumann said. \"It came back down on the range complex,\" she said. \"Fortunately, no people on the ground were injured. There was damage, but I'm not sure of the extent of it at this time.\" The launch complex is about 25 miles from the city of Kodiak. Witnesses watched the rocket lift off at 12:25 am, quickly head nose-down and explode, KMXT radio reported. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon is being developed as a joint project between the Army Space and Missile Defense Command and the Army Forces Strategic Command to form the Pentagon's Prompt Global Strike initiative. The Defense Department wants a weapon that can strike targets anywhere in the world within hours using a conventionally armed missile traveling at Mach 5 or 3,500 miles an hour. The missile would be used to hit terrorist targets identified on satellites thousands of miles away or weapons of mass destruction being moved in open ground that only have a small window within which to strike. The disastrous abort of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon in Alasak follows a failed test by the Chinese military of a similar system. The Wu-14 missile is being developed by China to launch nuclear warheads or to strike ships and is being designed to travel at speeds of up to Mach 10 or 8,000 miles-an-hour. Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post, said that the Chinese test of the Wu-14 three weeks ago failed in similar circumstances to the American test. According to the Washington Free Beacon, Russia too is attempting to develop its own hypersonic weapon. Source: Washington Free Beacon . Kodiak photographer Scott Wight watched the launch from Cape Greville in Chiniak, about a dozen miles from the launch site. He described the explosion as quite loud and scary. A fire afterward burned brightly. The rocket was the booster for the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, a glide vehicle designed to quickly reach a target. The design is one of several being tested by the Army under the umbrella of the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program, Schumann said. \"It's a concept that will allow the Department of Defense to engage any target anywhere in the world in less than an hour,\" she said. The first flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon on November 17, 2011, flew the weapon from Hawaii to Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. The test Monday was designed to enhance previous ground testing, modeling and simulation, Schumann said. Traveling at hypersonic speed, the glider also was aimed at Kwajalein and was supposed to cover the 3,500 miles in less than an hour, Schumann said. Experimental: Traveling at hypersonic speed, the glider also was aimed at Kwajalein and was supposed to cover the 3,500 miles in less than an hour . Experimental: This US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency artists rendering shows the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2). The US military had to detonate a hypersonic weapon seconds after lift-off on August 25, 2014 due to a technical problem, cutting short a flight test for the experimental project, officials said on Monday . Strike capability: The Falcon HTV-2 will be launched on a rocket into space then will glide back down to Earth. The 2011 test flight lasted only nine minutes before being deliberately crashed as a safety measure due to technical difficulties . It was a setback for the US program, which some analysts see as countering the growing development of ballistic missiles by Iran and North Korea but others say is part of an arms race with China, which tested a hypersonic system in January. Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said he did not think Monday's failure would lead to the program's termination. 'This is such an important mission and there is promise in this technology,' he said. He said officials aborted the mission after detecting a fault in the computers. Anthony Cordesman, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the technology was best suited for use against smaller, less-developed countries with missiles. 'The United States has never assumed that these ... are going to be systems that you can use against a power like China by themselves,' he said. 'For a country like Iran or North Korea, they could be a very significant deterrent.'

James Acton, a defense analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Pentagon had never been clear about the mission for the weapon, with some viewing it as an effective tool against terrorists and others seeing it as a counter to China or Iran and North Korea. While hypersonic weapons are unlikely to be fielded for a decade, Acton said the fact that Washington and Beijing were both testing the weapons indicated there was a real potential for an arms race. 'I believe the US program is significantly more sophisticated than the Chinese program,' he said. The weapon, known as the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, was developed by Sandia National Laboratory and the US Army. Schumann said it included a glide body mounted on a three-stage, solid-propellant booster system known as STARS, for Strategic Target System. In a previous test in November 2011, the craft had successfully flown from Hawaii to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, she said. On Monday, it was supposed to fly from Alaska to the Kwajalein Atoll. Acton said no conclusions could be drawn about the weapon based on Monday's accident because the launcher detonated before the glide vehicle could be deployed.",

From jokes and jibes aimed at rival teams, to passionate tributes to their own clubs, football fans have long used banners as a means of getting their message across. Now a UK academic has hailed the humble football banner as an 'art form', pointing out that supporters are becoming increasingly clever and creative when it comes to devising their slogans. Dr Jamie Cleland said that, while the intelligence of sports fans is often 'downplayed', the messages adorning football stands are just as likely to be witty political puns as crude jokes at other teams' expense. Witty: Irish football fans give their take on the EU bailout of their debt-stricken country at a Euro 2012 fixture . The Loughborough University professor highlighted a group of Ireland fans who turned up at the Euro 2012 tournament bearing a flag emblazoned with the phrase: 'Angela Merkel thinks we're at work'. The cheeky banner name-checking the German Chancellor was a reference to the EU bailout of the debt-stricken country, and made headlines during the football tournament. 'Fans respond to the news agenda of the day,' said the lecturer, who has conducted research into football fan-dom. 'Sports fans get down-played as not necessarily being very intelligent, but football fans can be very creative.' Dr Cleland also recalled seeing a sign that read 'MUFC AAA rating' in the stands at Old Trafford in the days after the UK was stripped of its prized triple A credit rating. The professor said the rise of social media meant a clever banner could give a football fan access to a form of short-term fame, as pictures of a popular banner could quickly go viral on Twitter or Facebook. The Art of Banner Banter, a touring exhibition of funny football banners, has been organised by Irish whiskey firm Tullamore Dew.

    "document": "(CNN) -- While the Bible Belt is known for its devotion to traditional values, Southerners don't do so well on one key family value: They are more likely to get divorced than people living in the Northeast. Southern men and women had higher rates of divorce in 2009 than their counterparts in other parts of the country: 10.2 per 1,000 for men and 11.1 per 1,000 for women, according to a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau released Thursday. By comparison, men and women in the Northeast had the lowest rates of divorce, 7.2 and 7.5 per 1,000, which is also lower than the national divorce rate of 9.2 for men and 9.7 for women. \"In the South, there are higher rates of marriage and higher rates of divorce for men and women,\" said Diana Elliott, a family demographer with the U.S. Census Bureau and co-author of the new report. \"In the Northeast, you have people who are delaying first marriages, and consequently there are lower rates of marriage and lower rates of divorce.\" Of the 14 states reporting divorce rates for men that were much higher than the U.S. average -- ranging from 10.0 to 13.5 per 1,000 -- most were in the South. They included Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. In contrast, men in the Northeast divorced less than the national average. Five of the nine states that had divorce rates for men significantly below the U.S. average -- ranging from 6.1 to 8.5 -- were the Northeastern states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania. The same was true for Southern women. Nine of the 14 states with divorce rates for women above the U.S. average, ranging from 10.7 to 16.2, were in the South. They included Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. By comparison, four of the 10 states with below-average divorce rates for women, ranging from 6.0 to 8.9, were in the Northeast: Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. A divorced mother of two who grew up in Virginia and is now living in the Atlanta area, Lynn (not her real name) said she knows why her eight-year marriage failed. She and her ex-husband got married after a whirlwind three-month courtship, and she now knows, \"You really don't know somebody after three months.\" She didn't have a college degree when she got married, although she did eventually graduate from college and is now a teacher. Lynn said she can see some reasons that Southerners divorce at higher rates than the nation as a whole. \"Where I grew up in Virginia, I saw some of my peers not finishing high school, some not going to college and some not finishing college,\" she said. \"I saw a lot of people just staying in my hometown, staying in dead-end jobs, just settling, taking very little risk-taking for their careers.\" Youth and lack of education can lead to higher divorce rates, said D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer with the Pew Research Center, who wrote a report on \"The States of Marriage and Divorce.\" There's also an interactive map on the website. \"There tend to be higher divorce rates in states where women marry young,\" Cohn said. \"Education also may play a role. In general, less educated women marry at younger ages than college-educated women, and less educated couples have higher divorce rates.\" Values about premarital sex associated with the Bible Belt and rural America may be encouraging people to marry early, at ages when they are likely to have less education and less income to support a long-lasting marriage, according to Naomi Cahn, law professor at The George Washington University Law School and co-author of \"Red Families v. Blue Families: Legal Polarization and the Creation of Culture.\" \"There's a moral crisis in red states that's produced by higher divorce rates and the disparity between parental values and behavior of young adults,\" said Cahn. \"There is enormous tension between moral values and actual practices.\" Lawrenceville, New Jersey, resident Jennifer DeBord, a married mother of two girls, made many decisions that could keep her 13-year marriage strong. She finished college, explored different careers, dated a few different men and lived with one boyfriend before figuring out what she wanted in a mate. DeBord and her husband, Jason, who works as a Broadway conductor and musician, both moved to New York City to pursue their careers in the arts. \"Waiting allowed me to find the person who was right for me, not the person who was available,\" said DeBord, 42. \"In my mother's time, you married the first person you spent time with. I would have divorced that guy. I had a much better idea of who I was (when I married) at 29 versus who I was at 19.\" It's ironic that pressure on people to get married early also puts them at higher risk of divorce, said Stephanie Coontz, history and family studies professor at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, and author of \"Marriage, A History: How Love Conquered Marriage\" and other books. \"The very fact that people feel less pressure to get married (in the Northeast) means they can be more selective about who they marry and take their time, \" Coontz said. \"They don't have to rush into it to please parents or avoid stigma of premarital sex.\" Whatever the reasons for the South's higher divorce rate, Christian author Jonathan Merritt said that church leaders are focusing more on divorce recovery when they should be focusing on preventing divorce. \"The faith community has a twofold responsibility regarding divorce: We need to respond to the divorce epidemic among our own ranks and we need to address the trend among the broader culture,\" said Merritt, author of \"Green Like God: Unlocking the Divine Plan for Our Planet,\" who also ministers at Cross Pointe Church in Duluth, Georgia. \"Marriages and families within faith communities are no healthier than in the rest of society. Faith communities must provide support systems to salvage damaged marriages and resurrect dead marriages.\" Meanwhile, divorce still pushes more women into poverty than men and affects their children, since children are still more likely to live with their mothers (75%) than their fathers (25%), according to the same U.S. Census report. Some other findings: . • Women divorcing in the past year were more likely than men to be in poverty (22% versus 11%). • Women divorcing in the past year had less household income than their male counterparts. Of those women, 27% had annual household incomes below $25,000, compared with 17% of divorced men. • Women who divorced in the past year were more likely to receive public assistance than men (23% versus 15%). • Children living with a parent divorcing in 2009 were more likely to live in poverty (28%) compared with other children (19%) and more likely to live in a rented home (53%) than other children (36%).",

    "document": "Homs, Syria (CNN) -- A freelance cameraman who visited Homs recently put together a video that provides a rare glimpse of life in the embattled city and an even rarer close-up of the opposition movement in Syria. At the headquarters of the government secret police, the cameraman -- who uses the name Mani to avoid retribution by the government if he returns -- finds himself in the thick of a battle. Some 200 members of the Free Syrian Army, made of military defectors, are involved in the attack. They explode a bomb below a rooftop position, where government snipers are trapped. In the video, portions of which CNN aired Friday, the opposition appears organized, their members communicating by walkie-talkie and engaging in fierce fighting. Casualties are taken via minibus to a makeshift field hospital, where they are placed on thin mats on the floor. \"My eye! My eye!\" shouts one man whose eye had been targeted by a bullet. Mani's camera follows opposition fighters as they enter the government building, where room-to-room and stairwell-to-stairwell fighting ensues. Finally, as bullets continue to fly, the opposition fighters make off with boxes of ammunition so they can return to fight another day. After 20 hours, 15 opposition fighters have been killed, 40 wounded. The next day, the building is gutted by local residents. Not all the battles are so bloody. Mani says they are sometimes able to persuade government forces to cede ground without firing a shot. \"They always try, first, to make negotiations work,\" Mani says. \"They talk with the officer, they talk with the soldiers, and they offer them either to defect, either to surrender, and leave the checkpoint. And sometimes it works.\" Civilian volunteers are plentiful; more and more, they are being joined by defectors from government forces, Mani says. Across Homs, some estimates put the FSA strength at more than 1,000. Each neighborhood has its own command, but they sometimes combine forces to improve their odds against the much larger and better-armed government forces. Some soldiers who don't desert nevertheless sell their weapons or ammunition to the opposition, the cameraman adds. \"There are many people who are in favor of them, who feel they are in favor of the opposition,\" Mani says. Down one street, his camera shows a long line of residents lined up outside a bakery for bread. \"Because of the snipers, people are taking more than they need,\" says the man who is handing out the loaves. \"That's why it's crowded.\" Two days earlier, in a nearby district, hundreds of residents fill the streets to mourn the deaths of 138 people in overnight shelling by government forces. Without enough coffins to go around, many of the dead are wrapped in white shrouds. \"Shelling people is what cowards and scoundrels do,\" the imam says. \"Be careful of gathering in public.\" \"We are going to heaven!\" the crowd chants, their fists pumping the air. \"There are millions of us!\" Mani comes upon a woman just as she learns that her son has been fatally shot by a sniper. \"He is my son! My rock!\" she wails. \"I have no man! He is my man!\" Her son, a former supporter of the regime, bears a tattoo on his chest that says \"Assad.\" Next to that is the entry point for the bullet. A couple of blocks away, the shelling that has pockmarked much of the city has spared a district where many residents belong to the Alawite sect to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs. Homs is now a patchwork divided along sectarian lines. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.",

A driver has been unwittingly given a £60 fine for driving in a bus lane when the actual offender was the council’s own roadsweeper. Jonathan Palgrave, 32, was stunned to receive the penalty notice from Sheffield City Council despite having never visited the city. The fine was sent to Mr Palgrave’s house, almost 100 miles away in Spalding, Lincolnshire, along with a photograph of the offending vehicle. Rego's wrong: Jonathan Palgrave was unwittingly fined £60 for driving in a bus lane in Sheffield - a city he had never visited before - after the council mixed up the 'E' in his number plate with 'B' in the offending vehicle's plates . Is it 'B' or 'E'? The council included this image of the offending vehicle, its number plate in clear view but it is not Mr Palgrave's Tiger kit car, rather it is a council roadsweeper in the bus lane . But the photo revealed a Sheffield City Council roadsweeper in the bus lane driven by a council worker wearing a fluorescent jacket on August 21. On closer inspection Mr Palgrave, who drives a Tiger kit car – not a roadsweeper, noticed that his number plate was exactly the same as the roadsweeper’s bar one letter, the council mixing up a ‘B’ for an ‘E’. But when Jonathan contacted the authority to point out their mistake, he was stunned to be told by council workers that he must still go through the authority’s official statutory complaints procedure before the fine could be overturned. He was also told the penalty could rise up to £90 if he failed to pay the fine within 28 days and threatened with possible legal action if it still wasn’t paid after that. 'Bureaucratic nightmare': Mr Palgrave contacted the council about the fine (right) after noticing that the offending roadsweeper (left) had a very similar number plate, but was told that he still had to go through the authority's official complaints procedure. The council have since cancelled the fine . Bus lane bumble: This intersection on the Ring Road in Wicker is where the bus lane camera caught the roadsweeper . Mr Palgrave said today: ‘It’s just been a bureaucratic nightmare and it makes you wonder if it has happened before. ‘It makes you want to know if it’s all automated or if someone looks at what they are actually sending out. ‘I think I might write back on the form “have a look on the back” so they look and see their own sweeper. ‘When . I first got it I just thought “oh my god, where have I been?” I thought . I was going to have to pay the fine. Then I realised I have never been . to Sheffield in my life, let alone driven there. ‘When I turned over the form I just laughed, there was the picture of this huge sweeper just sweeping the curb. ‘They . must have just mistaken the E in my car’s registration for the B in the . sweepers, that’s the difference, other than them being completely . different cars. Should check their records: Mr Palgrave, who has owned the £17,000 Tiger kit car for three months, said he has felt angry but not can't help but laugh at the mix up . ‘I’m almost tempted to wait and take this to court and see what they say when it all gets to court. ‘I’ve felt every emotion going - at first I was angry, then confused and now I can’t help but laugh about it. ‘To send a picture of their own vehicle, which they will have records of is brilliant. ‘They should really check those records from time to time.’ Mr Palgrave has owned the £17,000 kit car for three months. He said: ‘I’m happy with my kit car for now but perhaps I could avoid any potential parking and speeding tickets in future if I bought a council road sweeper.’ The letter from Sheffield City Council informed Mr Palgrave of his Bus Lane Penalty Charge Notice under the Transport Act 2000. It read: ‘The alleged contravention has been detected and recorded by an Approved CCTV device. ‘Sheffield City Council having reason therefore to believe that a penalty charge notice is payable, serves this PCN on you, as the person appearing to the Council to be the owner of the vehicle of the person liable to pay the penalty charge.’ Sheffield City Council today apologised for the embarrassing error and agreed to cancel the penalty notice. A spokesperson said: 'The ticket has now been cancelled and we apologise for the confusion. This is the first time this kind of mistake has happened.'",

A wave of car bombings rocked central and northern Iraq today killing at least 57 people during the deadliest eruption of violence to hit the country in years. Attackers initially targeted market-goers early yesterday, then turned their sights on police and army posts after sunset. Security forces scrambled to contain the violence, blocking a key road in central Iraq and imposing a curfew in the former Sunni insurgent stronghold of Mosul after the blasts went off. Increasing violence: Civilians gather at the site of a car bomb attack at Jadidat al-Shatt in Diyala province, 40 km north of Baghdad, yesterday . Killing in Iraq has spiked to levels not seen since 2008. The surge in bloodshed, which follows months of protests by the country's Sunni Arab minority against the Shiite-led government, is raising fears that Iraq is heading for another bout of uncontrollable sectarian violence. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks - as has been the case for much of the violence in recent weeks - but coordinated car bombings in civilian areas and against security forces are frequently the work of al Qaida's front group in Iraq, known as the Islamic State of Iraq. The deadliest single attack hit Diyala province when three parked car bombs exploded virtually simultaneously around a wholesale fruit and vegetable market at the height of business in the town of Jidaidat al-Shatt. The town is just outside the provincial capital of Baqouba, about 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. The blasts killed 15 people and wounded 46. Soon after the explosions, security forces sealed the roads linking Baqouba to Baghdad in an apparent effort to prevent further attacks. Reduced to rubble: A member of Iraq security personnel inspects the site of a car bomb attack at Jadidat al-Shatt in Diyala province . Shortly after midday yesterday, another car bomb went off near a fish market in the northern Baghdad suburb of Taji, killing seven shoppers and wounding 25, police said. In the northern city of Tuz Khormato, police said a parked car bomb exploded near a small outdoor market just before the sunset, killing three people and wounding 22. The town is about 130 miles north of Baghdad. The three car bombs used in the attack near Baqouba were deployed in different locations in and around the market in order to inflict the most damage and casualties, police said. One of the vehicles was a pickup truck loaded with produce that was parked inside the market. Last Friday, Diyala was the site of another deadly bombing. A suicide attacker drove an explosives-laden car into a bus carrying Iranian Shiite pilgrims visiting holy shrines in Iraq, killing 11 and wounding more than two dozen. The attack took place in the town of Muqdadiyah, about 60 miles north of Baghdad. Bombing at Jadidat al-Shatt in Diyala province was one of numerous attacks to hit northern and central Iraq . Last night, a rapid-fire wave of car bombings erupted in the volatile northern city of Mosul, killing at least 14 and wounding dozens. Police in Mosul said one suicide bomber rammed his car into a police post, killing seven police and one civilian. In another attack, a bomber detonated his vehicle at a security checkpoint, killing three. A similar attack on another checkpoint killed three police. A suicide car bomber also struck a security checkpoint near Madain, about 12 miles southeast of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and wounding 10 others, according to police. Four others were killed when a bomb exploded near a cafe in the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City in Baghdad. Police said the blast injured 12. Another explosion in the al-Ameen neighborhood in southeastern Baghdad wounded six. Hospital officials confirmed the death tolls.",

    "document": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Stars and Stripes, the newspaper that receives U.S. military funding to help it cover and get distributed free to American forces in war zones, complained Tuesday of censorship by military authorities in Iraq. A soldier with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division patrols the streets of eastern Mosul, Iraq, on June 16. In a story on its Web site, the newspaper known as Stripes said the military violated a congressional mandate of editorial independence by rejecting a request to embed reporter Heath Druzin with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division, which is attempting to secure the city of Mosul. The military cited various problems in Druzin's reporting on previous embed assignments with units of the division, according to the story. One example noted by the military was a March 8 story that said many Mosul residents would like the American soldiers to leave and hand over security tasks to Iraqi forces, the Stripes Web site said. \"Despite the opportunity to visit areas of the city where Iraqi Army leaders, soldiers, national police and Iraqi police displayed commitment to partnership, Mr. Druzin refused to highlight any of this news,\" Maj. Ramona Bellard, a public affairs officer, wrote in denying Druzin's embed request, according to the Stripes story. A military official in Iraq defended the move to turn down the reporter's request. \"U.S. Army units in Iraq remain committed to the media embed program and appreciate objective media reporting,\" said Lt. Col. David H. Patterson Jr., a spokesman for Multi-National Corps-Iraq. \"The relationship that Druzin established with the command during a previous embed did not facilitate being invited back.\" Patterson added that Druzin was welcome to embed in another unit and that the 1st Cavalry Division was open to having a reporter other than Druzin. \"Accusations of censorship are without merit,\" Patterson said. Other allegations against Druzin by the military included that he used quotes out of context, behaved unprofessionally and persisted in asking Army officials for permission to use a computer to file a story during a communications blackout period, the Stripes story said. Terry Leonard, editorial director at Stars and Stripes, denied the Army's allegations, calling Druzin's previous reporting on the division accurate and fair. \"To simply say 'you can't send him because we didn't like what he wrote' is unacceptable,\" Leonard said. He noted that Congress set up Stripes as an independent newspaper so that \"no commander can decide what news troops in the field receive.\" Army officials have offered to allow a different Stripes reporter to embed with the division or to allow Druzin to embed with a different Army unit in Kirkuk, Leonard said. Stripes rejected those offers because the military has no right to deflect coverage from Mosul or decide which Stripes reporter covers its operations, Leonard said. \"To deny Mr. Druzin an embed under the reasons stated by Maj. Bellard is a direct challenge to the editorial independence of this newspaper,\" Leonard wrote in his appeal to the decision, according to the Stripes story. \"That independence is mandated by Congress. The denial of the embed constitutes an attempt at censorship and it is also an illegal prior restraint under federal law. ... The military cannot tell us what stories to write or not write.\" Stripes receives close to $10 million a year from the Department of Defense to help defray the costs of covering \"contingency\" operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the publishing and distribution of roughly 85,000 free newspapers a day, Leonard said. The newspaper receives additional government subsidies, with the total amounting to less than half of its budget, he said. Other revenue comes from ad sales and circulation at permanent U.S. military bases and elsewhere, Leonard said. CNN has been denied embed requests on occasion but never because of the past conduct of individual journalists. The reasons have almost always involved logistical details involving security and force coverage.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- The charm of Ventotene is apparent the moment you spot it from the boat transporting you to its shores. Sitting there like a lonely sponge cake protruding from the surface of a clear blue plate, the island's sheer size -- or lack thereof -- promises something not only special but personal. Ventotene lies in the Tyrrhenian Sea just west of the mainland region of Campania. Arriving on this tiny island off the west coast of Italy, you enter the port built into the side of the volcanic island by the ancient Romans and only recently developed and expanded to provide for heavier traffic. The fishermen's boats lining the harbor along with pizza and scuba shops give the island that quintessential small-town Italian feel. To get to the center of the island, you walk the winding ramp to Piazza Castello, where the town hall sits. Grab a cappuccino at one of the two cafes there, which moonlight as restaurants during peak season from May to October. If caffeine doesn't satisfy you, grab a bottle of wine at one of the local alimentari and sit in the park right off the square for majestic views of the small uninhabited island of Santo Stefano (used to detain Mussolini's adversaries during his rule). Part of the cluster of islands known as the Pontines, Ventotene -- which gets its name from the Italian word for wind, \"vento\" -- lies in the Tyrrhenian Sea just west of the mainland region of Campania. It occupies less than a square mile, and its history dates to the Roman Empire, when emperors such as Augustus and Tiberius found the island's isolation perfect for banished troublemakers. During World War II, it was used as a listening post by a German garrison before being captured by the Allies in 1943. The island also has a rich literary history. It is thought that Homer intended this to be the spot where Ulysses confronted the sirens during his long journey home. John Steinbeck wrote about the 1943 U.S. raid on Ventotene while he was a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. During the day, you can sunbathe at one of the three main beaches. Cala Nave is the preferred choice for its accessibility, black volcanic sand and rock outcroppings that make for ideal basking in the intense Mediterranean sun. Ventotene has become a scuba diving destination because of its lush and mostly undisturbed aquatic life. There are several scuba-diving schools on the island, one of which was erected in the late '70s and is the oldest scuba academy in the whole of Italy. Private and group lessons start at 100 euros. Ventotene's size makes it perfect for simply setting off and exploring. Walking is cheap, and traversing the bright landscape -- which often doubles as cliff's edge because of the island's narrow width -- is rewarding not only for its brilliantly colored vegetation but also for its panoramic views and lack of entry fee. Lower on the island, discover the chiseled rocks pockmarked by saline (little crevices used to collect fresh salt water in ancient times) and the sea caves down by the port where transparent pools often act as windows into the astonishing marine life that surrounds the island. If you're looking for something a little less nature-oriented, there are two museums. Villa Giulia -- which is less enclosed museum than outdoor relic -- is the ancient remains of a structure that housed/imprisoned Emperor Augustus' daughter, Giulia, who was exiled there for her promiscuity and immorality. The other is the Archeological Museum, which in its more standard presentation holds many artifacts that have been uncovered on the island over the years. Unlike its more frantic (by Italian standards) and popular southern neighbors, Ischia and Capri, Ventotene has barely been touched by international tourism. The hotels are affordable, and the food isn't overpriced. Today, it's home to a year-round population of about 600. That number skyrockets during the summer months, especially in August, when it seems that every Italian heads to the seaside, or September, when the Festival of Saint Candice (Festa di Santa Candida) turns the island into one extended party. Ventotene's real appeal isn't in its breathtaking 360-degree sea views, its clear, clean water or even its architecture and people. There are other places in Italy just as stunning. Its charm is in the sense you get that you're experiencing something not discovered by the tourists who flock en masse to the rest of Italy year-round. A sense you're among Italians.",

    "document": "Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian protesters are vowing to continue their anti-government demonstrations into Wednesday night, despite violent crackdowns and arrests. Witnesses in Tehran tell CNN the demonstrators number in the tens of thousands. The protests are timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy. Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday, and tens of thousands showed up to hear anti-American speeches in front of the building that once housed the U.S. diplomatic corps. Many chanted \"Death to America.\" The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June, following a disputed presidential election. Thousands of protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home, many chanting \"Death to the Dictator\" and others saying, \"Obama - Either you're with us or with them,\" referring to the U.S. president. Riot police and pro-government Basij militia turned out in force to quash anti-government protests. \"We were running from the police in the alleys off of the main streets,\" said Soheil, an opposition protester, who gave only one name for security reasons. \"Strangers were opening up their garages so we could hide until the police went away. I ran into a garage for about 15 minutes. When I went back into the main street, I saw riot police arresting a group of young men, then putting them inside a bank and locking the door. \"Only God knows what will happen to them after that.\" iReport: Iranians take to the streets . Soheil, like many other of the demonstrators, took part in the protests this summer. As with previous demonstrations, many images of Wednesday's protest were uploaded to the Internet on the site YouTube.com -- including video of protesters walking over an image of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another clip showed a group of women being beaten by what appeared to be Iranian security forces. Witnesses said many Iranian women took part in Wednesday's demonstration, and were frequently targeted by the Iranian security forces -- which is what also happened during the summer protests. Video posted on YouTube showed many protesters beaten on the head with batons. Iranian reformists have chosen key anniversaries to protest the hardline government -- the same anniversaries chosen for government-sanctioned anti-American rallies. Wednesday's was the biggest annual anti-American observance of all. On November 4, 1979, Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy. They held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. There were also small pockets of protest on Wednesday in the southwest Iran city of Shiraz, according to a resident who witnessed the protests. Demonstrators marched down the main street of Shiraz, yelling \"Death to the dictator\" and \"We will not stand down to you, together we are united,\" according to Najmeh, who only gave her first name for security reasons. There was strong police presence on the streets, and the police force seemed much more organized than past occasions, she said. Earlier in the day, opposition supporters marched defiantly in Tehran's Haft-e-Tir Square, witnesses said. Many held up their hands in V-signs. Others shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" or \"God is great,\" which has become a slogan of protest. Police blocked all roads leading to the square, creating massive traffic jams. Witnesses described helmet-clad security personnel beating demonstrators with batons and firing tear gas at Haft-e-Tir Square and in a neighborhood a few kilometers north. \"I had never seen that many riot police and security personnel,\" a witness told CNN. \"They were brought in by the busloads. As soon as crowds gathered somewhere, riot police were there within minutes.\" The opposition showed Wednesday that even after five months of government crackdown, people were still willing to take risks. The disputed June 12 presidential election triggered Iran's most serious political crisis since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah. Led by opposition candidate Mir Houssein Moussavi, thousands of Iranians protested what they believed was a rigged vote that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office for a second term. In the election aftermath, the Iranian government arrested more than 1,000 people and accused reformists Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling anger among the public. But despite warnings from the government, Iran's reformists have largely refused to back down. They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government's official number. Both Moussavi and Karrubi were prevented from attending Wednesday's rallies, according to a reformist Web site, Norooz News. Karrubi's son told the Web site that his father tried to reach the Haft-e-Tir Square rally on foot, but he was blocked by anti-riot police, sparking clashes with his followers. Police fired tear gas toward Karrubi, hitting one of his guards on the head, and causing Karrubi and some of his supporters to fall to the ground, according to Norooz News. Karrubi and his followers returned to their vehicles and drove away when, at one point, security forces attacked and damaged Karrubi's vehicle, the Web site said. Video posted on YouTube showed Karrubi briefly opening his car door to a crowd of cheering supporters, who chanted, \"Honorable Karrubi, help the people of Iran.\" Iranian authorities had warned Karrubi to not participate in the marches, saying he might be the victim of a suicide attack, according to Norooz News. Moussavi was unable to join the demonstration after his car was prevented from leaving his office, according to his Facebook page and a report on a reformist Web site. Cell phone and Internet connections were cut in the area where his office is located, and dozens of plainclothes motorcycle riders blocked the entrance and chanted slogans against Moussavi, the Web sites said. Read analysis from Hamid Dabashi, author of \"Iran: A People Interrupted\" In Washington, President Obama said the world continues to bear witness to the Iranian people's \"calls for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights.\" \"Iran must choose,\" he said in a statement late Tuesday. \"We have heard for thirty years what the Iranian government is against; the question, now, is what kind of future it is for. \"It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it wants to focus on the past, or whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity, prosperity, and justice for its people,\" he said. Obama noted how the embassy takeover reshaped U.S.-Iranian relations. \"This event helped set the United States and Iran on a path of sustained suspicion, mistrust, and confrontation,\" he said. \"I have made it clear that the United States of America wants to move beyond this past, and seeks a relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect.\" Obama said America has demonstrated willingness to work with Iran over nuclear issues by recognizing its right to peaceful nuclear power and accepting a recent proposal by the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency. \"We have made clear that if Iran lives up to the obligations that every nation has, it will have a path to a more prosperous and productive relationship with the international community,\" Obama said.

    "document": "Perhaps it was a foregone conclusion, what with the Internet's proven ability to turn any new technology into a platform for showing naked people. But Twitter's new video-sharing app, Vine, is under scrutiny after early adopters started using it to flash six-second porn clips to the app's users and to the larger Twitter community. It's an issue that has Twitter scrambling to appease concerns. And it's raising questions about how Apple, the only place where smartphone users can download the app, will respond after recently banning other apps that provide access to sexual content. The issue gained attention Monday when Vine users noticed a video of what was described as hard-core pornography showcased in the prominent Editor's Picks section of the mobile app. Users took to the comment section of that video to complain. Twitter apologized Monday, saying it was a mistake. \"A human error resulted in a video with adult content becoming one of the videos in Editor's Picks, and upon realizing this mistake we removed the video immediately,\" the company said in a statement sent to CNN. \"We apologize to our users for the error.\" Released Thursday, Vine is a Twitter-owned app that lets users create and share videos lasting up to six seconds. As with photo-sharing app Instagram, Vine users can follow other people, whose posted videos show up in a feed on their phones or can be shared on Twitter and Facebook. The app is available only for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Vine's Apple-only status raises interesting questions. Just last week, Apple banned image-sharing app 500px from its App Store because it could give users access to sexual content. The 500px app features artistically rendered nudes among lots of other photos, but so do other apps with user-generated content, such as Tumblr, which remain available on Apple's iOS mobile system. The Vine app is rated 12+ on iTunes for \"infrequent/mild sexual content or nudity,\" among other reasons, meaning it's deemed appropriate for users 12 or older. As of Monday, it was the fifth most popular free app in the App Store. Apple did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story. Vine had been listed on Apple's own Editor's Choice list as early as Monday morning, but appeared to have been removed by Monday afternoon. Apple observers Monday were noting the strange position the company finds itself in. Apple has famously kept tight reins on what appears in its App Store and on its mobile operating system in general. The late CEO Steve Jobs famously argued that control on the front end delivers a user experience free from porn, spam and other digital unpleasantness. But as the digital Web grows and evolves, it's becoming tougher to parse the blurry line between apps that promote adult content (and which are turned down or banned by Apple as a matter of course) and those which simply provide access to such fare. What, for example, is the distinction between the banned 500px app and the app for Tumblr, the blogging platform which, among its millions of blogs, includes many that host explicit sexual content? \"From the start, Apple has said they'd get the App Store wrong, and come across things they didn't anticipate, but that they'd learn and grow,\" said Rene Richie, editor of Apple-centric blog iMore, in a post Monday. \"This particular problem has been around for years, but as social sharing has become easier, it's come to the surface again.\" Interestingly, it was just a little less than a year ago that Apple banned Viddy, a video-sharing app that has been compared to Vine, because it gave access to user-generated adult videos. The Viddy app was eventually returned to the App Store. On Twitter's end, the anything-goes aspect of Vine jibes with the site's overall philosophy. Compared to Facebook, which believes social sharing is best when tied to a user's true identity and real-world networks, Twitter allows its users to register under fake names and has fought governments and law-enforcement agencies seeking user information. As such, Twitter has taken a more hands-off approach on adult content. It's not hard to hunt down hashtags its users are employing to share adult content on a daily basis. (#TwitterAfterDark becomes a trending topic on the site nearly every day -- clicker beware). By contrast, searching for several suggestive hashtags (such as #naked or #porn) on Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app bought by Facebook last year, render no results. Because Instagram is an Apple-like closed environment, sexually explicit images are difficult, if not impossible, to find there. By Monday afternoon, hours after Vine had apologized and deleted the porn video from its Editors Picks, what uproar there was online was subsiding. As some observers noted, Vine isn't otherwise experiencing anything new in the tech world. \"As virtually every new video or photo-sharing service has shown us since the dawn of the Internet, from Flickr to ChatRoulette, it's very difficult to keep these sites or apps G-rated. So the companies either learn how to police it well, like Flickr does, or they wither and die, as ChatRoulette did,\" wrote The Atlantic Wire's Adam Clark Estes in a post titled \"Vine has a porn problem because, of course it does.\" In a statement to CNN, Twitter noted what had already become apparent on the app -- that users can report videos they deem inappropriate. \"Videos that have been reported as inappropriate have a warning message that a viewer must click through before viewing the video,\" a spokesperson said in the statement. Reported videos that are determined to violate Vine guidelines will be removed from the site and the user account that posted them may be terminated, according to the statement. Vine's terms of service ban illegal activity, harassment or abuse and behavior such as impersonating another user or violating trademark and copyright.",
    "summary": "An error led to a porn video being listed as an editor's pick in Twitter's new Vine app . Vine lets users shoot and post six-second videos from their phones . Twitter lets users flag offensive content, which gives other users a heads-up . Vine is only available from Apple, which has banned other apps over sexual content ."

    "document": "(CNN) -- Can you imagine a world where the sun never sets? For scientists cruising Antarctica in a mammoth 94-meter ship, that's exactly the surreal realm they encountered. Now their remarkable two-month expedition has been condensed into a haunting time-lapse video, following the floating laboratory as it plowed its way through some of the most brutal conditions on the planet. \"We arrived in summer, mid-February, when there was 24-hour sunlight,\" Stanford University Ph.D student, Cassandra Brooks, told CNN. \"The sun would move from high in the sky to very low, but would never completely disappear. I didn't get tired until 1.am -- it was very energizing.\" 'Touching infinity' Brooks, who is studying international ocean policy, was one of 30 U.S. scientists monitoring Antarctica's unique eco-system, as part of a National Science Foundation research cruise. The ship wound its way along the stunning Ross Sea -- believed to be the last untouched marine eco-system on the planet -- providing scientists with an important insight into one of our few remaining healthy waterways. During the summer months, Antarctica -- the southern most tip of the globe -- is transformed into a bewitching \"Land of the Midnight Sun,\" where the sun never dips below the horizon, instead continuously moving in circles. After more than a week of this extraordinary phenomenon, the team finally saw their first sunset at 1.am -- an experience Brooks described as \"like touching infinity.\" \"Brilliant orange light streamed through the portholes on the starboard side of the ship. I peeled myself away from my microscope, dashed across the room and peered outside to catch the sun blazing down on the horizon,\" the 33-year-old said. \"The sight took my breath away -- the sky was on fire, turning the ocean a deep purple red. Gusts of wind collided with the wide rolling swells, driving an arc of brilliant pink spray 10 feet into the air.\" Life and death . Despite the breathtaking beauty of this icy underworld, conditions could also be brutal with winds of 110 kilometers per hour and temperatures plunging to -40C. On these extreme days, scientists weren't allowed outside on the deck covered in a slippery -- and dangerous --layer of ice. \"If you fell overboard you'd be dead within minutes because the water is below freezing,\" said Brooks. \"Yet it's an environment that's also teeming with animals such as emperor penguins and Weddell seals.\" Sometimes tightly packed ice up to 10 ft deep threatened to trap the ship -- Brooks admitted on previous expeditions it had been stuck for weeks -- and it was forced to spend hours reversing and ramming its way through. The adventure was caught on film after Brooks attached a video camera to the bow of the boat -- capturing everything from blazing sunshine to fierce storms. 'Forget Friday night' For more than two months, the team cruised Antarctica's wild Ross Sea -- more than 5,000 kilometers from the closest country; New Zealand. Their ship, the Nathaniel B Palmer, became a floating island in itself, equipped with a helicopter hanger, gym, industrial kitchen, library, conference room and laboratory. Brooks was part of a team measuring plankton in the water and would usually start her experiments at 7.am, working until 8.pm. During the summer months, Antarctica's green plankton bloom grows so large it can be seen from outer space. \"We were there to test what happens to all that phytoplankton, which provides a vital source of carbon -- or food -- to the system,\" Brooks explained. \"Does it sink out to the bottom? Get eaten over the summer? Does it get transported out of the system? Many think that this large source of phytoplankton is the reason why the Ross Sea has such large populations of predators. \"Some people would still be up sampling water until 4.am,\" she added. \"The idea of weekends and normal Friday nights completely disappears.\" Spiritual science . For Brooks, the journey was more than just a science expedition -- it was a spiritual experience which gave her a renewed appreciation for mighty mother nature. \"It just grabbed me in a very visceral way,\" said Brooks. \"It's such an obviously beautiful place but also surreal -- the conditions are so extreme so you're seeing a whole other world you've never seen before.\" Many scientists now believe the Ross Sea is the last untouched marine ecosystem in the world. If Brooks' stunning video is anything to go by, it's also one worth protecting.",

    "document": "By . Chris Kent . PUBLISHED: . 03:33 EST, 4 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 4 May 2012 . A teenage boy has admitted religiously harassing a McDonald's worker - by persistently mocking her because she is a Pagan. The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, visited the fast food restaurant frequently over a period of more than six weeks to taunt the woman over her beliefs. The case is understood to be the first in the UK to involve a case of religious harassment against a Pagan. The boy, who lives in Lawford, Essex, pleaded guilty to religiously aggravated harassment at Colchester youth court on Wednesday. Religion: A 16-year-old boy has admitted religiously harassing a Pagan in Essex. Pagans, such as these at Stonehenge, worship a variety of deities . Magistrates banned him from contacting the woman and gave him a three month referral order, which means he must report to a panel of youth workers and may be forced to do unpaid work. The court heard how the boy repeatedly went to the McDonald's restaurant in Colchester, Essex, between December 24, 2001 and February 18 and harassed the female employee because she was a Pagan. Paganism, the followers of which include druids, shamans and heathens, is recognised as a religion under UK law. Prosecutor Simon Newell said: 'Religiously aggravated harassment is an unusual offence - the first I have dealt with, especially one where perhaps not everyone would consider it a religion, but it is deemed to be so. 'The defendant has found out others have called her a Pagan and he has jumped on the bandwagon. Diverse: The Pagan community features a range of people, including druids, shamans and heathens. Paganism is classed as a religion . Banned: The boy, 16, has been banned from eating in the McDonald's in Colchester, Essex . 'He was soon made aware of the effect it was having by the victim and senior staff. 'He knew this was unacceptable and then continued. 'He accepted in interview he did it to annoy her.' However, Mr Newell added: 'He did not know it constituted religious aggravation and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.' Paganism describes a group of contemporary religions based on a reverence for nature. It encompasses a diverse community, including Wiccans, druids, shamans, sacred ecologists and heathens. The majority of Pagans share an ecological vision that comes from the belief in the spirituality of the natural world. Pagans do not worship the devil or practice 'black magic' and their practices do not involve . harming people or animals. The number of Pagans in Great Britain is estimated at between 50,000 and 200,000. The Prison Service recognised Paganism as a religion in 2000. Laura Austin, mitigating, said: 'He is apologetic and did not realise Paganism was a recognised religion. 'The teasing was going to a level where the victim got very upset about it. 'His parents are not happy with him and have imposed their own curfew. 'You do wonder if the employers could or should have done more to prevent the behaviour.' The court was told the teenager had been banned from eating in the restaurant and was only allowed to order food to takeaway. The boy had an existing referral order, which magistrates extended by three months. He was also given a restraining order, banning contact between the teenager and his victim until November. After he was sentenced, the boy offered to write a letter of apology to his victim. No order was made for costs or compensation. Cas Morehan, the franchise holder of the McDonald's store, said: 'Unfortunately there are instances where staff are subjected to harassment and abuse by customers.'",

    "document": "Miraculous recovery: Ex-England batsman John Edrich claims he recovered from cancer thanks to extracts of mistletoe . An international cricket career that spanned two decades, he won a reputation as a dogged and fearless batsman. Now, John Edrich is applying the same determination to fighting cancer – with a little help from mistletoe. The opening batsman, who played 77 tests for England between 1963 and 1976, has credited the experimental tumour treatment with saving his life. Edrich was given just seven years to live when he was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer in 2000. His health deteriorated so badly by 2005 that he told his wife Judith he was on the brink of death. Shortly afterwards, he heard about Stefan Geider, an Aberdeen GP who uses injections of mistletoe extract as a cancer treatment. He has never looked back. The 75-year-old is on the golf course three times a week and says he feels on top of the world. Speaking from his home in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, Mr Edrich said: ‘My quality of life was grim. I said to my wife, Judith, “This is the end”. I was so tired and lethargic, I couldn’t do anything. Then three or four days later a friend of a friend rang me and said I had to see Dr Geider because his treatment had worked wonders with another patient. There is some evidence that compounds found in mistletoe can have an effect on cancer cells, but there is little concrete proof of its value as a treatment at present. Scientists claim extracts from the plant: . The use of mistletoe extract is . widespread in Europe, particularly in Germany, but the third mistletoe . symposium in that country - reported on in the British Medical Journal - detailed a long . list of possible side effects from mistletoe, from nausea to herpes. The issue is also confused by the fact that mistletoe is sometimes used as a homeopathic remedy - which is never recommended as a key treatment for any type of cancer. ‘When I went along, I asked him whether he thought I could really get better and he said “You will be all right, John”. ‘The difference now is incredible. Mistletoe is not the final cure, but whatever is inside it certainly helped me. Without it, I don’t think I would be here today.’ Mistletoe has been touted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s and experiments show it can kill cancer cells in the lab. Doubts remain however about how effective it is in the human body. Dr Geider said that in some cases injections of the plant can help shrink tumours. Other patients seem to benefit from a better quality of life, more energy or a healthier appetite. The doctor, who is to carry out a clinical trial of the treatment on breast cancer patients, said: ‘Mistletoe has to my experience helped a lot of patients tremendously. ‘But it does not work for everybody – it’s not a miracle cure. We need to find out why the mistletoe works for some people, and not for others – that’s why we need the trials.’ Professor Steven Heys, an Aberdeen University cancer specialist who will help run the trial, told the BBC: ‘There isn’t any evidence that mistletoe does have an anti-cancer effect, in terms of prolonging the life of patients. Unusual methods: Dr Stefan Geider, left, a GP at Aberdeen’s Camphill Medical Practice, suggested the radical treatment using the traditional winter plant, right . ‘What it does do, possibly, is improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer who are having chemotherapy. ‘Therefore I think it’s important to look and evaluate that and study it, in very good randomised controlled trials, conducted in a very controlled setting.’ Mr Edrich was diagnosed with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia in 2000. ‘I hadn’t seen a doctor for about ten years, but I’d been feeling tired for a while,’ he said. ‘Having taken blood tests they discovered leukaemia. It was quite a shock. You can’t fight it. ‘I think we’ve got to be grateful for what we’ve had. I did something which I loved and had the ability to play cricket at the highest level.’ Mr Edrich’s fearlessness on the pitch saw him twice returning to the wicket to bat during the 1974-5 Ashes tour despite having his hand and later ribs broken by balls from Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee. He comes from a famous Norfolk sporting family and four of his cousins played first-class cricket. A scorer of 12 centuries for England, his best effort was 310 not out against New Zealand in 1965.",

A top lawyer at the US parent company of the News of the World and Sun newspapers described the prospect of a corporate charge as ‘apocalyptic’, threatening 46,000 jobs in America if it went bust. Yesterday Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation’s management standards committee (MSC), set up internally to investigate business practices, believed that by handing material on individual employees to police it would save the company. But police denied any deal was done. Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation management standards committee believed that by handing material on employees to police it would save the company . The revelation came in the trial of six senior Sun journalists accused of ‘corruption on a grand scale’ paying police, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for stories over a decade. Head of news, Chris Pharo, 45, picture editor John Edwards, 50, managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporters Jamie Pyatt, 51, and John Troup, 49, are accused of conspiring to corrupt public officials, paying for information about celebrities, murderers and royals. All six deny the charges. Nigel Rumfitt QC, defending Pharo, said: ‘They (MSC) were keen to be seen to co-operate with the police.’ Detective Superintendent Mark Kandiah agreed: ‘They certainly were co-operative.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘In slang, they were shopping their own staff.’ The company received a letter in May 2012 from the CPS informing them a corporate liability charge was a possibility. Minutes of a meeting a month later between the MSC and police indicated committee chairman Lord Grabiner was not sure the firm would have assisted ‘if they had been told this last year’.

In another meeting News Corporation lawyer Gerson Zweifach said 46,000 jobs were at risk. The minutes read: ‘It [a prosecution] could kill the corporation. This job [co-operating with police] was to defend the company... The downstream effect of a prosecution would be devastating and apocalyptic.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘The point he was making was if the company was charged, rather than individual employees...the company could go bust.’ The trial continues.

    "document": "Nine small earthquakes rattled North Texas just hours apart on Tuesday, though no damage has so far been reported from the temblors. The magnitudes of the earthquakes, which began around 7.30am, ranged from 1.6 to 3.6, according to the USGS. Earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel. The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb. At least two of those could be felt throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Seismologists also installed a new earthquake-monitoring device in Irving this week, after minor temblors rocked an area which is near the site of the former Dallas Cowboys football stadium. Scroll down for video . Map: The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb in North Texas . The first quake at 3:10 p.m. measured 3.5 in magnitude. Another at about 7 p.m. measured 3.6, while tremors at 8:11 p.m. and 8:12 p.m. measured less than 3.0. The first four happened within an area near the Trinity River that's seen a swarm of mild temblors in recent months. USGS geophysicist Jana Pursley says Tuesday's quakes were the 'largest since the earthquakes started happening there in the last year.' According to NBC DFW, a 1.7 earthquake took place close to a Dallas intersection at 9:54pm, and a 2.4 earthquake hit Irving's University of Dallas campus at 10:05pm. A 1.6 earthquake struck at 11:02pm - and like many of the other quakes, was also in the vicinity of the Trinity River, the affiliate station reported. Carrieann Bedwell, a geophysicist with the USGS in Golden, Colorado, said senior scientists would be investigating the temblors. 'They will be looking at the parameters, magnitude, depth, location of each of the events,' Bedwell said Wednesday. 'Right now we're calling it a swarm, because we've had multitude events happen.' The seismic series has left residents on edge, wondering if the situation will get worse and what has been behind an uptick in quakes over the last several years. 'The safety and security of our residents is paramount for the city of Irving,' said Irving City Manager Chris Hillman. Some residents believe the implosion of Texas Stadium in 2010 may have exacerbated problems. There is also speculation the quakes might be related to hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking,' an energy extraction technique that has a long history in north Texas. Trouble: Some residents believe the implosion of Texas Stadium in 2010 may have exacerbated problems with earthquakes in the area . Irving, headquarters of Exxon Mobil's XTO unit that helped pioneer hydraulic fracturing in the region, has two gas wells that were fracked in 2010, according to city officials. The Irving area, with a population topping 250,000, has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early September, according to Brian Stump, a seismologist with Southern Methodist University. 'SMU's seismology team is committed to helping North Texans understand more about the increasing number of earthquakes felt in our region over the last few years, most recently near the city of Irving,' Stump said in a statement Tuesday. SMU researchers installed a seismometer in Irving on Monday. Other devices were set up earlier near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and on the Dallas campus. The study is aimed at pinpointing the quakes' epicenters, Stump said. About 40 miles west of Irving, a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of Azle a year ago, causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations. Residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending. Energy industry officials have said fracking is safe and causes no significant seismic damage.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- In a single column, a veteran police officer has catapulted himself into the national debate over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. \"I'm a cop. If you don't want to get hurt, don't challenge me,\" the Washington Post headline blares. The piece was written by Sunil Dutta, a 17-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department. \"Even though it might sound harsh and impolitic, here is the bottom line: if you don't want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you,\" he wrote. Dutta cautions against arguing, insulting, or screaming at officers, \"and don't even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?\" If you believe an officer is violating your rights or bullying you, Dutta says, don't challenge him then -- save that for lodging a complaint later. \"Do what the officer tells you to and it will end safely for both of you.\" It took no time for the anger over his message to explode. \"The outrageous thing is not that he says it. The outrageous thing is that we accept it,\" writes Ken White of the blog Popehat, which tracks American legal issues. \"Do we have a justice system? By name, yes. Is it effective in deterring cops from abusing citizens or punishing them when they do? No... If you hope the cop will be charged criminally for misbehavior, you're going to be waiting a very long time for no result.\" Dutta's message is to \"shut up and take it, because even the slightest bit of intransigence is grounds for the cops to unleash a world of hurt,\" writes Benjamin Freed of the Washingtonian. \"To say that putting up a verbal argument warrants bringing out the billy clubs, stun guns, or actual guns only stokes what's been seen coming out of Ferguson in the past week -- images of peaceful demonstrators being met with a lines of officers rigged with military-grade equipment, marchers being fogged with canisters of tear gas, and people being slugged with rubber bullets after not moving quickly enough,\" Freed complains. Authorities in Ferguson say force has been needed to stop the minority of \"agitators\" who have fomented violence, through gunshots and Molotov cocktails. CNN.com users weighed in on social media. \"So, 'Do what I say or I will hurt/kill you?' How does that even remotely correspond with 'To Serve and Protect?'\" Carter Gaddis wrote on Twitter, citing the police motto. But Rhonda Heim wrote on Facebook, \"I think an officer puts his life on the line on a daily basis. He wants to go home after his shift like everyone else. No one should challenge him.\" Mike Knox, a business owner and father of four in Ferguson, told CNN \"people are just tired\" of being pulled over when they did nothing wrong, so it's common to give police attitude in the area. But he teaches his children not to. \"When you see police, respect the police,\" he tells them. \"Say 'yes sir and 'no sir.' It'll get you a long way.\" And since loitering can lead police to think you're up to no good, he adds, \"keep it moving.\" \"If you let your attitude take over, that can be you laying on that ground,\" Knox adds. In Dutta's column, published Tuesday, he writes, \"Cops are not murderers. No officer goes out in the field wishing to shoot anyone, armed or unarmed.\" Still, he does not defend all police. \"I know it is scary for people to be stopped by cops. I also understand the anger and frustration if people believe they have been stopped unjustly or without a reason. I am aware that corrupt and bully cops exist. When it comes to police misconduct, I side with the ACLU: Having worked as an internal affairs investigator, I know that some officers engage in unprofessional and arrogant behavior; sometimes they behave like criminals themselves.\" Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . Dutta notes that people don't have to submit to illegal stops or searches, and can refuse consent to search a car or home without a warrant. \"Always ask the officer whether you are under detention or are free to leave. Unless the officer has a legal basis to stop and search you, he or she must let you go. Finally, cops are legally prohibited from using excessive force: The moment a suspect submits and stops resisting, the officers must cease use of force.\" But protesters throughout the country say submitting to an officer doesn't always avoid police brutality. They point to the case of Eric Garner, killed by New York police in a chokehold in July. And in California, a 51-year-old woman was seen on video being repeatedly punched by a Highway Patrol officer. In a CNN.com column last week, Iris Baez of the Justice Committee in New York wrote that her son died nearly 20 years ago in an illegal police chokehold. \"These tragedies and injustices happen year after year, and people of color -- primarily black and Latino -- are usually the victims.\" \"Police-community relations can only start to improve when individual officers who abuse civilians' rights are held accountable with a zero-tolerance policy for police brutality,\" she says. Dutta wants all police to use body cameras and video recorders in their vehicles, which \"will prevent a situation like Mike Brown's shooting, about which conflicting and self-serving statements allow people to believe what they want.\" The events that led up to the teen's shooting remain unclear, with very different descriptions emerging. While Dutta comes off as \"reasonable,\" he is demanding \"unresisting submission to police without argument or even legal protest,\" J.D. Tuccille writes at Reason.com. \"Just how do you 'refuse consent to search your car or home' without running afoul of the no-nos Dutta warns may get you 'shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground?'\" Journalists who were arrested amid Ferguson protests have reported they did nothing wrong. Dutta, a professor of homeland security and criminal justice at Colorado Technical University, could not be reached immediately for comment Wednesday on the uproar over his column. In a tweet linking to his response, the Washingtonian's Benjamin Freed wrote, \"I challenged Officer Sunil Dutta. Hopefully he won't come hurt me.\" Magazine: The aftermath in Ferguson .

    "document": "The Syrian government has warned protesters in the city of Homs to stop demonstrations, hand in weapons and surrender defecting military members by Monday night or face bombardment, an opposition leader said. A 72-hour warning was given Saturday, said Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdo of the Free Syrian Army. Activists on the ground said the ultimatum was issued on Friday. The Syrian National Council, the country's leading opposition movement, had warned earlier of a potential bloodbath at the hands of the Syrian regime in Homs. \"If the world continues to watch, then the massacre of Hama in the '80s will be repeated,\" said Hamdo, referring to 1982, when Syria's military -- acting under orders from current President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- launched an assault on the city, killing thousands. Opposition: Anti-regime doctor killed . The military has dug trenches around Homs, Hamdo said. \"There is no electricity, water, or communication whatsoever now and the communication breakdown has extended even closer to the Turkish border,\" he said. The Syrian government denied reports of water and electricity being out in the city, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). The government made no mention of the reported deadline on the news agency's website Sunday morning. Opposition figures launched a nationwide anti-government strike Sunday, which they called the \"strike of dignity.\" The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gets information from people in different parts of the country, said people in Homs and neighboring towns widely joined the strike. \"All shops were closed on all main roads in the city,\" the group said. Several videos posted on Youtube purported to show government loyalists breaking locks of shops that closed in support of Sunday's anti-government strike. But on SANA, the Syrian government quoted people across the country as saying there was no strike and no sign of a strike. \"It was a normal trading day in markets throughout the Syrian provinces as people bought and sold consumer goods, vegetables, fruit and clothes as economic elements shrugged off all inflammatory tendentious calls by terrorist groups that are associated with foreigners,\" the government insisted. Protesters attack employees at Syrian Embassy in Jordan . As violence raged Sunday in parts of the country, the death toll reached 23, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC). Five of the dead were children, the group said. The toll includes six people in Hama; six in Homs; five in Idlib; three in suburbs of Damascus, and three in Daraa, according to the LCC, a network of anti-regime activists in the country. One of the deaths in the Daraa area took place in Jasem, where a man was arrested and then returned to his family dead after about three hours, the LCC said. In the city of Aleppo, security forces burned down a factory in an industrial area that was participating in the strike, the LCC said. SANA, meanwhile, reported that the \"bodies of 13 martyrs from the army, security and police forces\" were taken \"to their final resting place.\" Four were from Homs. Authorities in Homs arrested \"armed men who tried to impose an obligatory sit-in\" and who shot at people in cars and streets, SANA said. CNN cannot independently confirm events because the Syrian government restricts access of international media to the country. The Syrian government said authorities in Idlib \"confronted members of an armed terrorist group\" who were blocking a road and \"killed and injured a number of its members.\" Authorities also chased another \"armed gang\" and killed two of its members, SANA said. In Hama, Syria said, officials arrested \"a member of armed terrorist groups\" who was trying to plant an explosive device near residential buildings. SANA said the military dismantled the bomb and no one was injured. Throughout the Syrian uprising, government officials have described some opposition fighters as armed terrorists and gang members. There were clashes Saturday in Khan Sheikhon, where authorities \"arrested a number of the terrorists and killed three of those groups' prominent leaders,\" SANA said in a report Sunday. In the city of Kfar Takharim, \"a number of the members of armed terrorist gangs were killed or injured in clashes with the authorities on Saturday evening,\" SANA said, adding that one member of the authorities was killed and six others were injured. Fierce clashes were underway Sunday in the Daraa Province village of Busra al-Harir as Syrian troops battled defectors, leaving many people wounded, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Residents said members of Syria's 12th Armored Brigade, which is based near the border with Jordan, \"stormed\" Busra al-Harir. They said they heard explosions and heavy gunfire in the city and just north of it in Lujah, where defectors were believed to be hiding, the observatory said. Security forces in Idlib were using mosque speakers to threaten residents to end their strike and to force people to reopen businesses, the observatory said, citing eyewitnesses. The Arab League announced it will hold emergency meetings this week in Cairo. In a statement on Egypt's state-run MENA news agency, an Arab League official said leaders will \"discuss the Arab response to a message from Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem to approve the signing of an agreement on an Arab League observing mission to Syria with conditions.\" World leaders have widely condemned Syria's crackdown and called on it to halt violence against the opposition. On Saturday, France expressed its concerns about events in Syria, and warned against Syria launching a military operation against the city of Homs and its population, the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Al-Assad's regime has denied targeting peaceful protesters. The regime's actions have outraged world powers and sparked sanctions by the Arab League, Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Israeli President Shimon Peres on Sunday described Syrian President al-Assad as a \"killer,\" implicitly comparing him to Libya's ousted ruler Moammar Gadhafi. \"The world decided -- including the Arab world -- to intervene when a leader is beginning to kill his own citizens,\" Peres told CNN in an interview. \"It happened in Libya; it's happening in Yemen; it's happening by the Arab League, for the first time in their experience. They decided to put pressure on an Arab state because the leader is killing his people.\" The United Nations said this month that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since the crackdown began in mid-March. Protesters have been demanding the end of the al-Assad regime and democratic elections. Al-Assad has been in power since 2000; his father, Hafez, ruled Syria for three decades. Local elections are set to take place Monday for municipal posts. In its 2010 Human Rights Report about Syria, the U.S. State Department said Syria's elections have not been fair in the past. \"Although the constitution provides the right for citizens to peacefully change their government through elections, in practice they did not have that right because elections were neither free nor fair,\" the report said.",

    "document": "Gamers have slammed hackers who knocked out Playstation and Xbox networks on the day millions received consoles for Christmas. The online networks which allow game players to get the most out of their new machines went down yesterday, leaving many youngsters frustrated and parents furious. Notorious hacking group Lizard Squad, who had previously brought down both networks earlier this month, claimed responsibility for the sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. As the disruption dragged on into a second day today, many desperate gamers sent messages to the group on Twitter, urging them to return service to normal. Scroll down for video . Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service . In one of hundreds of similar messages, Andrew Quintero wrote: 'Could you guys please let PSN back on?' Others, such as London's Luca Rizzo, turned their anger on the companies, calling on them to improve security. He wrote: '@XboxSupport when is online going to be back on? This is a joke were missing out on xmas gaming because of a hack! We want answers!' Microsoft and Sony both used Twitter to acknowledge the issues and to assure users that they were doing everything they could to restore their services. At 2:30pm this afternoon, the Playstation's network was offline and, while many Xbox Live services were up and running, the service's status was described as 'limited'. On Boxing Day morning, Xbox support tweeted: 'Some Xbox One users may currently be experiencing issues signing into Xbox Live.' Around the same time, Playstation's support team posted: 'Our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today. Thanks for your continued patience!' Hundreds took to Twitter today to complain about being unable to connect to the console's networks . The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4. Occasional downtime is par for the course for both services, but Christmas Day is a particularly bad time to be hacked, just as hundreds of thousands of PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones were being unwrapped and set up for the first time. Lizard Squad had first announced earlier this month plans to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day. It described itself as the 'next generation Grinch.' Another hacker group, The Finest Squad, then emerged, saying that it would stop the group and bring its members to justice. The Finest Squad tweeted at about 5pm ET that they had Xbox 'pretty much restored.' The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony's decision to let consumers download the controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources. Lizard squad is a hacking collective who have claimed responsibility for a series of hacks on games networks. This year the group has been linked to cyber attacks on EA games, Destiny and previous hacks of Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network. Threats posted after a previous hack on Xbox Live claimed it wouldn't be the last. They wrote: 'Microsoft will receive a wonderful Christmas present from us.' Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch' It had previously been alleged the group used a Russian internet domain, leading to claims they were based in that country. However, it was claimed online today that they are in fact a group made up of one Canadian, three men from the US and two from the UK. One of the men from Britain declined to comment on the claims when contacted by MailOnline, another was unavailable. The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4 . Microsoft used Twitter on Christmas Day to keep gamers updated about the issues impacting on Xbox Live . There was anger on Twitter today as parents and youngsters expressed fury at not being able to use their expensive Christmas presents properly. Wigan's Christine tweeted: 'Why hack Xbox & Playstation on Xmas day to stop kids playing with there presents....modern day Scrooge' Another website user added: 'Can't believe people have nothing better to do on Xmas than to hack into Xbox Live and play station network and shut them down' And IT tecnicial Jon Massey wrote: 'Cant figure out why they would hack Xbox + PSN. Way to spoil the Christmas for the kids who were lucky enough to get consoles...' Three Xbox platforms were affected by the service problem: Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Xbox on other devices, Microsoft's status website said. 'I have the nation on strings,' Lizard Squad wrote on its Twitter site. It also said it would put the sites back online if enough people retweeted its messages. Sony also used Twitter to keep PlayStation Network users abreast of the issues it was facing . Rival hacker group, The Finest Squad, claimed via Twitter on Christmas Day that they had restored Xbox Live . In the past, Lizard Squad have overloaded both Microsoft and Sony's gameplay services, as well as Blizzard's online gaming network. Distributed denial-of-service attacks or DDoSing - occurs when massive numbers of people or automated machines flood servers with external data requests, crippling the computers to the point where they grind to a halt and are effectively frozen. This is what happened when Lizard Squad attacked the Blizzard and PlayStation Network servers in August. It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding. The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones. Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved. A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain.",

    "document": "Ordeal: Rosemary Fadle appeared at two sensational trials over the past few weeks . It has been an extraordinarily painful and harrowing week for Rosemary Fadle. She had the satisfaction of seeing Jimmy Savile’s partner in crime Ray Teret – who raped her when she was an innocent 15-year-old – convicted for numerous offences for which he is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail. Then, in a bizarre coincidence, days after giving evidence against Teret she flew to Paris to face the ‘nightmare’ of appearing as a witness in the high-profile trial of businessman Ian Griffin for the murder of his wealthy Polish girlfriend Kinga Legg. Bizarrely, the two sensational trials both reached a verdict on Friday with Griffin, like Teret, found guilty. Waiving her right to anonymity and speaking about her ordeal for the first time, Rosemary, 61, said: ‘Friday was a simply incredible because both the trials finished on the same day. It was an amazing coincidence. ‘I had got back from France the day before and to be watching the news with both these trials involving myself leading the broadcasts was unreal. ‘Obviously I was delighted that Teret was convicted and that included his offences against me. ‘I just wish my evidence had made a difference to Ian Griffin.’ The verdict in Paris disappointed her as she was there as a witness for the defence, and gave a damning character reference against Kinga Legg, who had once been part of her social set in the North West nightclub scene. Rosemary added: ‘It has been the most stressful time of my life and I have found it very difficult to sleep with the knowledge of what I had to do. ‘Now I feel exhausted but very proud for having helped to put Ray Teret behind bars. ‘I just hope that now other women will feel confident enough to come forward and report the abuse they suffered at his hands.’ Rosemary said it is the Teret trial that will haunt her. She revealed she was left particularly distraught because she had to face up to the memory of introducing a 12-year-old friend to Teret, who was then raped by him while she was in the same room. Scroll down for video . ‘It is something I will never be able to forget,’ she said. ‘I saw that particular victim in the lead up to his trial and I apologised for what had happened all those years ago. She just said that it had stolen her childhood from her and that she had tried to forget it. ‘She didn’t want to dig up the past and there must be hundreds of young girls in the same position. ‘Ray was a very cunning paedophile. He would do what he wanted to do and just act like nothing had happened. He even befriended my parents and would drop me off in his Bentley when it was time for me to go home. ‘We were so naive. I wouldn’t have known how to tell my parents. Because I did not have the experience of screaming and pushing him off me, I did not realise I had been raped.’ Partners in crime: Disgraced DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile and his chauffeur Ray Teret (right) soak up the sun in the 1970s . Charity event: Kinga (second from the left) and Rosemary (second right) pictured together at a party . Such was Rosemary’s level of naivety that when Teret latched on to her mention of a 12-year-old friend she thought nothing of introducing them. ‘I had mentioned her to him and he had encouraged me to bring her round,’ she said. ‘We were all lying down on his bed with Ray in the middle. Then he said to my friend, “This is not going to hurt”, and got on top of her. ‘I just lay there frozen to the spot while they had sex. When he finished he just started chatting away about his DJ-ing. It was as though nothing had happened.’ Rosemary was a pupil at Norris Road School in Sale, Manchester, in the summer of 1968 when she first encountered Teret, then 27, who had made his name as a DJ on the pirate station Radio Caroline. She said: ‘He lived with three other young DJs on the ground floor of a three-storey townhouse in Sale. My older sister happened to be renting the top floor and I would often go round to see her after school. If my sister wasn’t in, Ray would invite me into his flat to wait for her. He had the largest room in the house – on the ground floor with a big bay window. There were pictures of him with the Beatles on the wall and in the middle of the room was a kingsize bed. ‘I suppose I was flattered by the attention and it wasn’t until the third occasion that anything happened. ‘He told me to lie down on the bed and said he was not going to hurt me. He came and lay on top of me. Before I really knew what was happening he was having sex with me. ‘There was no tenderness. It was just clinical. Over the seven years he abused me, he never kissed me. He would just have sex, pass me a tissue and then start talking like nothing had happened. ‘Had I ended up running out of his house I might have thought of myself as a victim but he was very clever. He would always keep me there for an extra hour. He told me how lucky I was that I had lost my virginity to him rather than to another man who might have hurt me.’ Ray Teret (left) and businessman Ian Griffin (right) arriving art court in Manchester and Paris respectively . Last week Teret, 73, who used to be known by the nickname ‘Ugli’, was convicted of 18 offences against 11 separate victims aged 13 to 15. The offences were committed between 1962 to 1978 and the court heard that while some victims had been able to get on with their lives, others were ‘very significantly damaged’. A few years after the abuse had begun, Rosemary began dating Teret’s housemate and fellow DJ Mel Scholes. Ray wasn’t bothered about me seeing Mel because he had so many schoolgirls visiting him at that time,’ she said. ‘But if Mel and I fell out or he was in the house with me alone then he would force himself on to me again.’ At the time, Teret provided DJs for some of the North West’s most popular night spots. He was also very close to Savile, acting as his chauffeur on occasions. Rosemary said: ‘I met Savile once. Ray and Mel had moved to a big detached house that we called Teret Towers. I was lying on the floor reading a book when Savile came in. ‘He saw me and began to flirt. I remember he put his foot on my back and said he was going to walk on me. Ray gave him a glare and Mel took me out of there. ‘The strain of what was happening at Teret Towers put paid to my relationship with Mel. I couldn’t understand why he and the other DJs could not stop Ray from seducing so many schoolgirls.’ Living in the North West meant that throughout her life she would occasionally bump into Teret in a bar, a club or at the shops. Rosemary, who has five children from two different relationships, said: ‘We would usually say hello and nothing more. ‘On one occasion I saw him when I was shopping with my ten-year-old daughter who was a particularly pretty little girl. ‘Ray immediately started asking who she was and looking for an introduction. I rushed her away from him. It made me feel sick.’ Rosemary went on to be a successful businesswoman running bars and nightclubs in the North West, and was delighted when the death of Jimmy Savile triggered a re-examination of historical sex abuse. The Hotel Bristol in Paris where the Polish millionairess was found murdered by her boyfriend . To help secure Teret’s conviction she gave three video-recorded interviews to detectives but then also went to Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to give evidence. ‘I had no screen,’ she said, ‘and Ray was intimidating me throughout my evidence but I was determined that justice should be done. ‘Ray was just a few feet away from me and he spent the entire time making eye contact with me, nodding and shaking his head. It was truly terrifying. ‘I held it together really well. I stood for the whole time clinging on to a rail and the only time I cried was when I had to recall going to see a counsellor when I was 50 years old. ‘That brought it home to me just how this man had ruined my life.’ It was just days after giving evidence against Teret that Rosemary was called to be a witness in the case of Ian Griffin. Rosemary said she had become involved after pictures of her and Kinga emerged and she was contacted by Griffin’s distraught mother, Janet. ‘She asked me what I knew of Kinga and how I could help,’ said Rosemary. ‘Well, I knew Kinga from 2002 when she was dating a friend of mine called Harry Gaynon. Kinga admitted to me that she had a problem with drink which made her violent. On one occasion I saw her slap Harry across the face at a party and on another occasion she left him badly scarred. ‘No one deserves what she went through but I thought it was important that the French court knew what she could be like.’ Griffin was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Rosemary said: ‘I was very surprised that he received such a long sentence.’ She described the Paris trial as ‘a complete nightmare’. ‘I was shown to a waiting room which was full of Kinga’s friends and family and I felt awful knowing that my testimony was going to upset them all. ‘It was very uncomfortable but having been contacted by Ian’s mother I felt duty-bound to say what I knew about Kinga’s behaviour in relationships and her problem controlling her temper when drunk.’",

The glitzy presentation at the cavernous Joe Louis Arena was an attempt to grab the headlines at the United States' premier auto show, where power and luxury have roared back to the fore. Ford had given very little away in the lead-up to the first major international auto show of the year, but speculation had been rife that it had something special in mind. Scroll down for video . Praise: Car enthusiasts sprang forward to talk up the new Ford GT, unveiled Monday in Detroit, Michigan . Mighty: The sleek new model has 600 horsepower and twin-turbocharged engines . And it did not disappoint, unveiling a new GT model for next year - which that immediately won glowing approval from car enthusiasts. The new GT, an update to the legendary sports car last produced a decade ago before the US industry plunged into crisis, boasts 600 horsepower and twin-turbocharged V6 eco-boost engines. Ford did not reveal the exact pricing at the show, according to autoexpress, but said the it is likely to be similar to the price of the Lamborghini Aventador, which is £260,000 ($390,000). It signals Ford's readiness to put the years of austerity from the 2008-2009 recession behind it, when things like circuit-ready supercars were seen as expensive excesses. Brash: The powerful new car marks a return to confidence after the auto industry was rocked by the financial crisis . Gather round: Journalists and guests at the motor show crowded round the car as soon as it was unveiled . Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive, called the GT a showcase for Ford's most advanced efforts in lightweight materials, power-and-fuel conservation in its engines, and aerodynamics. 'We looked at how we were driving innovation through the company,' Fields said. 'And we said to ourselves, let's have a showcase where we can highlight that innovation and technology in a really dramatic way.' The GT will be available late 2016, Fields said, marking the 50th anniversary of the company's original high-performance racer, the GT40. But Fields was coy when asked if the new GT would be racing at Le Mans or Sebring. 'We have nothing else to talk about besides just presenting this great looking car.' Ford had already been in the spotlight in Detroit, snapping up the award for best truck, for the new aluminum F-150, while the Volkswagen Golf was named North American car of the year.

Trouble is, when those two faltered, there to take up the slack was Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood and their wonderful rookie partners, Victor Dubuisson and Jamie Donaldson. Most of all, there was the prodigious gifts and warrior instincts of Justin Rose and his Swedish partner Henrik Stenson. Rose’s partnership with Poulter might have been broken up but the former is fast compiling a Ryder Cup record of which the latter would be proud. The two points he contributed on Friday with Stenson takes his overall record to eight victories from 11 matches spread over three Ryder Cups. Rose is one of those Mr Dependables who could play with anyone. He has taken over the role of largely unsung hero Westwood used to play. Here in the tricky breezy conditions he was immense and the competitor in Stenson rose to the challenge of being an able partner. Average by his standards in the morning, the Swede was at his awesome best following the break. As ever, the first day of this 40th edition had plenty that intrigued and lots to analyse; plenty to keep fans of the sport and beyond in rapt conversation at the 19th hole. At its heart lay an astonishing decision from American captain Tom Watson that sucked all the momentum built up by the visitors in the morning and left them crestfallen at the finish. The story at half-time was that Europe had somehow contrived to lose yet another series despite winning one match comfortably and leading two more with just the final three holes to play. They would lose one and halve the other to concede the first series by a point. That took their record to two wins out of the last 12 series of fourballs and foursomes.

Team Europe's Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson line up a putt on the 18th green during the foursome afternoon match on the first day of the 2014 Ryder Cup . Inevitably there were grumblings but any questions about some of the pairings and why a natural front man like McIlroy was stuck in the anchor match became a faded memory thanks to Watson’s howler. Comfortably the best golf in the morning was played by the youngest American partnership in Ryder Cup history — 21-year-old Jordan Spieth and 24-year-old Patrick Reed. To be fair, it was a Watson masterstroke to pair them together, for they didn’t just take down Poulter and local hero Stephen Gallacher — they wiped the floor with them. The two rookies were full of it afterwards and rightly so. They were the talk of the Glen. The Americans present were buoyant. Who would the new American dream pairing be taking on in the afternoon? They were benched. World number one Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia (pictured) turned their fortunes around to salvage a halve after losing their morning session on Friday .

Sportsmail's graphic shows why it is good Europe started brightly against USA . Naturally, they could not believe it. Who could? They pleaded with their captain. ‘They’re very upset with me right now,’ admitted Watson. They were not alone, among those with American interests at heart. And so the momentum shifted. Donaldson and Westwood were majestic in beating the noted foursomes players, Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar, on the final hole. Poor Mickelson, now 44 and with an arthritic condition, looked like a man who could hardly believe he was being sent out again, and played tired golf — who would have thought that? — in losing to McDowell and Dubuisson. Even America’s only half point in the afternoon must have felt like a loss as world No 1 McIlroy and world No 3 Garcia came back from two down with two to play. What a start we had to proceedings. It is an incredible logistical exercise to get 50,000 people on to a golf course situated in the middle of nowhere for a 7.35am start but the hardy Ryder Cup regulars, as ever, were up for it. The park-and-ride car parks started filling up at 5am and by the time the gates opened at 6am, there were thousands waiting to make the mad dash for the best seats in the 3,000-capacity grandstand around the first tee. By 6.15am, some 45 minutes before the sun started peeking above the Ochil Hills, there were no unoccupied seats at all. Daylight revealed a magnificent landscape, with spectators occupying every possible vantage point — and soon the songs began. ‘Ten-six, and you still can’t win,’ was one chant, a reference to the epic turn of events at Medinah. Bubba Watson was first out for America and when he cupped his hand to his ear the thrilled crowd knew what that meant. So it was he boomeranged the ball in trademark fashion to a deafening ‘Ole’ accompaniment. That, however, was as good as it got for the Masters champion and his hapless partner Webb Simpson. A special reception was afforded Poulter and local hero, Stephen Gallacher. Poulter pounded his chest, the frustrated footballer to the end. It looked as if the occasion was too much for Gallacher, while Poulter lost for the first time in eight Ryder Cup matches. Curiously, all four of his defeats have come on the opening day. Just a minuscule contribution in points terms from McIlroy and Poulter, then, but no matter. To American chagrin, this was the day European golf displayed all its considerable strength in depth.

    "document": "By . Associated Press . Last updated at 4:43 PM on 22nd September 2011 . A young American ballet star has become the first foreign dancer to become a 'premier' with the famed Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. David Hallberg, who will also remain a principal with the New York-based American Ballet Theatre, received the distinction earlier this year. Until now, foreign dancers were only invited for guest stints and traditionally it has been stars from Moscow who move to the U.S. So harsh was the political climate, even those dancers that fled the Soviet Union were said to have faced death warrants ordered by the KGB. Stunning moves: David Hallberg leaps across the stage during the American Ballet Theatre's production of The Bright Stream. The 29-year-old has won a place at the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow . But in an interview, Hallberg, from South Dakota, made it clear he fully grasps the significance of his move. 'It's a milestone,' the 29-year-old said by telephone during a break in rehearsals for an upcoming tour. 'It's historic. It's a huge challenge, but I feel it's important, not just for me as an artist, but for the dance world - and, in the bigger picture, maybe even for international relations.' Historically, some of the finest dancers from eastern Europe have moved to the U.S. Rudolf . Nureyev defected to the West in 1961 and Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1974 - . both great dancers who fled the Soviet Union for freedom and better . opportunities. Legendary Russin ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev performs a similar move to David while in rehearsals alongside Zizi Jeanmarie . The leader of the Societ Union, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, attempted to keep Nureyev in the country and a KGB death warrant is said to have been ordered for him. But Hallberg's reverse move shows how much the world has changed. Hallberg, at 29, is already regarded as one of the most talented male ballet dancers in the world. In six years as a principal with ABT, he has captivated audiences with his pure, elegant form, weightless jumps, regal bearing and tall, blond good looks. He performs in modern as well as classical pieces, but is especially suited to princely roles such as Siegfried in Swan Lake, Albrecht in Giselle or Romeo. First approached by the Bolshoi in April, . while performing in Moscow, Hallberg said his decision took time and . was extremely difficult. East to West: From left, Rudolf Nureyev, who defected from the Soviet Union to the West in 1961, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, also from Russia, who defected to Canada in 1974. Poise: Nureyev, who died in 1993, performs alongside Merle Parke at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden . 'It was really hard because the responsibility is really great; there's a responsibility to really do this justice,' he said. 'I by no means want to compare this to the weight of the defections of Misha (Baryshnikov) and Nureyev. I wasn't even around yet. I can't imagine what it was like for them.' But, he added: 'There is a correlation. This is about the globalisation of the world, and the globalisation of dance in particular.' Hallberg said he will split his time between the two companies, living both in New York and in Moscow. In a statement, the Bolshoi hailed its newest 'premier', or principal. 'Mr Hallberg ... possesses all the best qualities of classical dancer - perfect technique, refined manners and outstanding acting abilities,' said artistic director Sergei Fillin. Hallberg's first appearance with the Bolshoi is expected to be Giselle, with the young Bolshoi sensation Natalia Osipova as his partner. The two won raves when they performed the ballet together at the New York based ABT. 'We have a special connection,' Hallberg added.",

    "document": "Editor's note: Ted Danson is an Emmy Award-winning actor, a founding board member of Oceana, the world's largest international organization dedicated solely to ocean conservation, and narrator of a new film, \"End of the Line.\" For more information about Oceana, read here . Ted Danson says a \"closed\" sign on a beach led him on a 20-year quest to save the world's oceans. (CNN) -- Today, Monday, June 8, we recognize the first U.N.-sanctioned World Oceans Day. The event comes after years of pressure from conservation groups and thousands of activists who clamored for everyone to know and understand what's happening in our oceans. I became an ocean activist in 1987. It was the fifth year of \"Cheers\" and my family moved into a neighborhood that was on the water, in Santa Monica, California. One day I took my daughters to the beach to go swimming, but it was \"closed\" and I couldn't answer my daughter's question why. That's really how it started. That and \"Cheers\" was paying me a lot of money and I felt I had better be responsible with it. So, I started to get involved. It turned out in our new neighborhood there was a fight to keep Occidental Petroleum from drilling 60 oil wells on Will Rogers State Beach in Los Angeles. They wanted to slant drill into the Santa Monica Bay. The fight was led by a man named Robert Sulnick and we became great friends and found a way to beat them. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we wanted to continue this work. So Robert Sulnick and I, full of passion and naiveté, started American Oceans Campaign, which ultimately became a part of Oceana. And, here I am, still at it, 20 years later -- because our oceans are in trouble. Watch Danson talk about his commitment to save the world's oceans » . The U.N. reports that 75 percent of seafood species are maxed out or overexploited and catches of nearly a third of these species are less than 10 percent of what they once were. Ninety percent of the big fish -- sharks, tuna, swordfish -- are already gone, according to a 2003 study in Nature. The chemistry of the oceans is changing as they absorb 11 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, and scientists say the acidifying waters will make it impossible for coral reefs, the nurseries of the sea, to grow. At the current rate of acidification, corals, sea snails and other calcium-carbonate-requiring life forms could begin to dissolve by the middle of the century, with potentially catastrophic results. Shellfish and fish will be in deep trouble as well. This is all happening on our watch. My friend Charles Clover, then a reporter for the U.K.'s Telegraph, wrote an incredible book about all of this called \"The End of the Line\" that lays out, in devastating detail, how this has happened. The book is now a film, released today, and I'm honored to serve as the narrator. The movie describes how marine scientist Daniel Pauly (a fellow Oceana board member) discovered China had been falsifying its fish catch data, and that instead of increasing, global fish catch had actually peaked in the late 1980s at about 80 million tons a year and had been falling ever since, despite better and faster technology and billions of dollars in government subsidies. The film also describes how we are about to fish one of the most magnificent fish in the ocean, the bluefin tuna, into extinction. It's not the only one we're eating into oblivion. Cod, once a staple in the working man's lunch of fish and chips, is increasingly a delicacy. Unable to catch once-prized species, fishermen are selling creatures that you would never have considered eating, like the once-disdained skates that replace scallops on European tables. Even jellyfish are becoming a commercially viable species. World Oceans Day is an opportunity to bring these underwater challenges to light. And it's a chance to explain how we can restore our oceans to their former glory. Ocean conservation is rewarding because you absolutely can make a difference. You leave a fish population alone for a while, and it rebounds. The oceans are incredibly resilient. We have the opportunity right now to protect the oceans and the life they harbor for future generations. By protecting important habitats like corals from destructive fishing techniques, and setting science-based quotas on seafood species, the battle is halfway won. Fish species will recover, and the marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds that rely on them for sustenance have a fighting chance. In addition, we must commit to renewable energy sources to end the excessive carbon dioxide emissions that are acidifying the oceans and making them inhospitable to life. The ocean does represent a source of energy, and it's not offshore oil and gas drilling -- it's offshore wind. Europe is a leader in developing offshore wind power, and it's time for the United States to catch up. Today, on World Oceans Day, don't just go green. Go blue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Danson.",

    "document": "London, England (CNN) -- How much does it cost to renovate an \"uninhabitable\" wing of a 17th century palace to make it fit for a future king and queen? Now we know: £4.5 million ($7.6 million). That's what the British taxpayer has put toward the refurbishment of Apartment 1a, Kensington Palace, which recently became the official residence of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George. But the true cost is higher, because the couple also put in hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own money for additional improvements. For example, public money was used to renovate the existing kitchen, but Catherine and William wanted a second \"family kitchen,\" which they paid for themselves. A royal spokesperson said: \"Kensington Palace has a working kitchen provided by the Sovereign (public) Grant to support receptions and other public events which might be hosted there. There is also a much smaller family kitchen paid for privately by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\" The general rule applied to the project was that basic works would be paid for from the public purse, and anything beyond that would be covered by the Cambridges themselves. It was a major renovation. The apartment was last lived in by the Queen's late sister, Princess Margaret, but in recent years was used as office space. It needed updating and reshaping into a family home. Asbestos was discovered throughout the building, so in the end, nearly everything was stripped out internally, and even the roof had to be replaced -- all to exacting standards to meet historic building regulations. The name \"1a\" downplays the grandeur of the property, with its more than 20 main rooms and expansive garden. But what's it like inside? Well, we haven't been allowed in to see, but a Royal Household source describes \"a very ordinary level of furnishing.\" And added: \"It's not opulent.\" The project was subject to the normal competitive tendering processes, and an independent quantity surveying firm confirmed to the Household that the costs are \"commensurate with building projects of a similar size, sensitivity and complexity.\" It won't be open to the public though, which begs the question: Why are they paying for it, especially when the Cambridges are also renovating a private home outside London? The Household source confirmed that the apartment would be used for official engagements, which means invited guests and, presumably, media will get a chance to see inside. The Queen received £36.1 million ($61.3 million) from the British Government for the 2013-14 financial year in what's called \"The Sovereign Grant,\" and it covers the costs of her public duties and the upkeep of palaces including Kensington. There's a major backlog of repairs throughout the estate -- 40% of it isn't up to standard, according to the Household source. Most of the services in Buckingham Palace date back to 1949. So was Kensington Palace given priority over other repairs? \"Yes, in that we needed it for occupation,\" said the source. The figures have been revealed in the Royal Household's Annual Report and Accounts, which also showed Prince Charles spent nearly £250,000 ($425,000) on a private jet to Nelson Mandela's funeral. The Household source says there was massive demand for charter flights by heads of state to attend and that was the cost to charter at that time. \"This was the only realistic way of getting him there in time.\" The palace points out that the cost of the monarchy is 56p (95 cents) per head of the British population, but that doesn't cover the vast costs of security for the palaces and individual members of the royal family. The Royal Household source notes: \"The cost of security is a cost of terrorism rather than a cost of the monarchy.\" And that, they point out, is something they cannot control. Prince Harry joins Twitter .",

    "document": "Wayne Rooney was presented with the ‘golden cap’ by fellow England centurion Sir Bobby Charlton at Wembley in front of 80,000 fans on Saturday. With England’s Under-21s side looking impressive in their 3-1 victory over Portugal on Thursday, Sportsmail looks at four players who could follow in Rooney’s footsteps. Saido Berahino . Called up by Roy Hodgson for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and friendly against Scotland. Saido Berahino is set to win his first cap next week, but can he emulate the likes of Wayne Rooney? Berahino has been impressive at youth level, and could become the first refugee to play for England . He has scored seven goals in the Premier League for West Bromwich Albion this season, only Alexis Sanchez (8), Diego Costa (10) and Sergio Aguero (12) have scored more. The 21 year-old is also the top-scorer in the Under-21 2015 UEFA Championship qualifying campaign with eight goals. The West Brom academy graduate initially struggled going out on loan to Northampton Town, Brentford and Peterborough United, but since returning to the Black Country the energetic striker has found his feet in the Premier League. The West Brom striker has scored seven times already this season, including against Manchester United . After reported interest from Liverpool West Brom decided to open fresh contract talks with the much sought-after youngster. He only signed a new four-year extension with the club in December 2013. Likely to make his international debut on Tuesday against Scotland at Celtic Park. Harry Kane . Tottenham Hotspurs' most impressive player in a so-far disappointing transition under Mauricio Pochettino. Despite being the joint-top scorer in this season’s Europa League with five goals he has only started one game in the league to the annoyance and bemusement of many of Spurs' fans. Harry Kane has scored six times for the U-21s, and Roy Hodgson has hinted at a full cap not being far away . Kane has been a bright spot during a disappointing start to this season at White Hart Lane . The North London club have lost four out of five home games this season, while Kane has warmed the bench, but his performances in Europe have given the indication that he could be the man to provide the lethal touch that Pochettino and the club badly need. A product of the Spurs’s academy Kane has represented England at every youth level, scoring 6 goals in 9 appearances for the Under-21s, but is yet to make an appearance for the senior side. Danny Ings . Scored 21 goals in the Championship last season as part of Burnley’s promotion to the Premier League subsequently winning 2013-14 Championship Player of the Year. Has scored just once in the Premier League this season, but netted twice in England’s Under-21’s 3-1 win over Portugal on Thursday evening at his home-ground Turf Moor. Danny Ings' form in the last season attracted attention, and he has shown international potential . The 22 year-old former Bournemouth man has four goals in six Under-21 appearances, mainly down to his physical presence in and around the box. Burnley’s next three games against Stoke, Aston Villa and Newcastle could see him improve his top-flight tally. Patrick Bamford . Chelsea’s exciting young prospect has experienced Football League environments for the last three seasons playing on-loan at MK Dons, Derby County and this season for Middlesbrough. Played once for the Republic of Ireland Under-18s, before switching allegiance to play for England. Since 2010 he has playing for the Under-18s, 19s and 21s, making his Under-21 debut in November 2013 as a substitute against San Marino. Patrick Bamford is exceptionally highly thought of at Chelsea, and could be an England star of the future . Bamford once represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level, but is now fully committed to England . In his spells at Derby and now Middlesbrough the young Chelsea striker has shown a killer instinct . Considered by some of Chelsea’s coaching staff to be the next thing, he has certainly impressed with his consistent performances and goalscoring in the Championship and League One.",
    "summary": "Wayne Rooney made his England debut at 17 in 2003 against Australia . Became the ninth England player to reach 100 caps on Saturday . A quartet of Under-21s strikers could be the future of English football ."

    "document": "Members of Kenyan police and intelligence units accused of hunting down and assassinating terror suspects have claimed the killing of a controversial Muslim cleric was planned by high ranking officers and government officials. The men, who are part of three so-called death squads, spoke out about their secret activities after more than 60 people were killed in two separate terror attacks by Al Qaeda-linked terror group al-Shabaab in the last month. Speaking anonymously, they revealed that instead of arresting suspects they 'eliminate' them, and claimed the death of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed, who was accused of recruiting 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite, was ordered by the Kenyan National Security Council. A gunman (left) and a commando (right) from the Kenyan General Service Unit have spoken out about their roles in so-called death squads allegedly tasked with hunting down and killing terrorists . A spy from the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) (left) said his job is to find and identify the suspects, while an officer from the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (right) claimed hundreds of suspects are killed by police every year . Ahmed, who was also known as Makaburi - meaning graveyard, was shot dead in April as he walked from a court in Mombasa to a nearby mosque. Human rights activists' have previously raised fears over police brutality in Kenya and claimed that the country's government - rattled by the presence of Islamic extremists - has been behind the deaths of several terror suspects. However, the Kenyan government has denied it runs an extrajudicial killing programme. Speaking exclusively to an Al Jazeera investigation programme, which will be aired on Monday evening, the four men - all members of Kenyan intelligence and special police units - say they have all been involved in the assassination of terror suspects, with one claiming to have killed more than 50. 'We don’t arrest,' a gunman from the Radiation Unit of the Kenyan General Service Unit's (GSU) elite Recce Company told the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit. The ATPU police officer and the GSU Recce Company commando said that controversial cleric Abubaker Shariff Ahmed (pictured) had been killed by police and his death ordered by the government . 'We never. In Recce Company we are sharpshooters. Why should a sharpshooter be taken to arrest?' He added: 'I’m in Radiation. And Radiation, that thing is very dangerous.' Describing his typical day he said: 'Usually eliminations happening here and there; in Mombasa, Muslims, radicals and all that. 'We are the elimination programme.' The gunman appears in the programme Inside Kenya’s Death Squads alongside a commando from Recce Company, a member of the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) and a spy for the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS). According to Al Jazeera, which agreed to conceal the men's identities for security reasons, all of the officers play an integral part in Kenya’s counter-terrorism strategy and all have had a hand in assassinating suspects. According to Al Jazeera, which agreed to conceal the men's identities for security reasons, all of the officers play an integral part in Kenya’s counter-terrorism strategy and all have had a hand in assassinating suspects . Speaking anonymously, the four officers revealed that instead of arresting suspects they 'eliminate' them . The ATPU police officer and the GSU Recce Company commando said that Ahmed had been killed by police and his death ordered by the government. In November last year, Ahmed had told Al Jazeera that he feared for his life, and predicted that counter-terrorism police would kill him. He died on April 1 and his companion was also shot dead. Ahmed . had been linked to fugitive terror suspect Lewthwaite, dubbed the White . Widow, as he helped more than 100 Britons to join Al-Qaeda-linked terror group al-Shabab, which counts her as a member. The British Muslim convert is . the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering . the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, . and three others with links to al-Shabab. However, in September last year Ahmed denied ever having met Lewthwaite, who is the widow of of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay. Although described by some as charismatic and intelligent, Ahmed held radical views and notably said that the four al-Shabab gunmen who slaughtered at least 67 people in Nairobi's Westgate Mall in September 'had every right to do what they did'. Attack: Rescue workers at the Nairobi-bound bus that was ambushed by al Shabab militants who killed 28 passengers when they were unable to recite an Islamic creed . Mortuary attendants carry in the bodies of 36 quarry workers killed by insurgents in Mandera, which is around eight miles from the border with Somalia . 'Islamically it is justified. We cannot allow foreign forces entering Muslim countries, killing innocent Muslim people and then it go unpunished,' he said, citing Kenya's military presence in Somalia and the need for an 'eye for an eye' defense of Muslim life. 'Makaburi was killed by the police,' the ATPU officer told Al Jazeera. 'That execution was planned in Nairobi by very top high ranking police officers and government officials.' The commando added: 'The government did it yeah. This is the person who’s bringing trouble here, let us eliminate and we have peace.' The ATPU officer also told programme makers that the government’s National Security Council gives the order to execute terror suspects. He said: 'It comprises of the President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, NISIS Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and the Principal Secretary Interior. 'Any decision is made within that club of people.' Kenya has been hit by a spate of terror attacks at the hands of al-Shabab, which militants say are being carried out in retaliation for Kenya taking part in UN-backed peacekeeping activities in Somalia in October 2011. Last Tuesday militants from the Somali-based group killed 36 quarry workers, most of them Christian, in Mandera, which is around eight miles from the border with Somalia. On November 22, al-Shabaab fighters stopped a bus bound for Nairobi and shot 28 passengers who could not recite an Islamic creed. Authorities say the terror group has been behind at least 135 attacks, including the assault on Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall in September 2013 in which 67 people were killed. Al-Shabaab said it was responsible for other attacks on Kenya's coast earlier this year which killed at least 90 people. The officers in the programme said they believe assassinations of terror suspects is necessary because of the threat the country faces from insurgents. 'Since I was employed, I’ve killed over fifty', said the commando from Recce Company. 'I do become proud because I’ve eliminated some problems.' Asked if human rights should be taken into account he described a terror suspect as 'a very dangerous person to our country'. 'What do you do with such a person?', he said. 'Do you spare such a person because you are observing human rights? He added: 'The first person to get rid of is the leader.' And the ATPU officer claimed hundreds of suspects are killed by police every year. He said: 'Day in, day out, you hear of eliminating suspects. We have the police itself. We have special units like GSU. So not a total, but you can say about almost 500.' He added: 'That is police work.' Speaking about one case he confessed: 'They were targeted, identified and eliminated in front of their families.' The spy told the programme that his job is to find and identify the suspects. 'We pass the right information to the right source for the right action to be taken against them,' he said. Asked if his intelligence is used to eliminate suspects he answered: 'Yes, of course. We’ve done it and that is why we are there.'",
    "summary": "Kenyan officers speak out about their work in so-called death squads . Men told how instead of arresting suspects they 'eliminate them' They claim cleric linked to Samantha Lewthwaite was executed by police .

Two soldier brothers banned from fighting together to prevent a double tragedy were both blown up the same stretch of road in Afghanistan. But the two bothers have both returned home alive, with their escapades bearing a striking resemblance to Steven Spielberg's film Saving private Ryan. Welsh brothers Nathan, 22, and Craig Williams, 21, were prevented from fighting together by military bosses to prevent their family from losing both in a single attack. Brothers in arms: Nathan Williams, left, and Craig Williams, right, were both involved in Taliban IED attacks in Afghanistan. But both brothers have returned home safely to Swansea, Wales for Christmas . The safety measures proved futile, however, as both brothers were involved in Taliban attacks in the same area only three weeks apart. Thankfully for the Williams family, the brothers have both returned home to Swansea for Christmas after their lucky escapes. The soldiers from Delta Company of 1st .

Success: Saving Private Ryan, starring Tom Hanks, left, and Matt Damon, centre, was nominated for 11 Academy Awards . 'One . day towards the end of my tour, we’d been taking some troops to a . checkpoint and were on our way back to camp when we hit the IED. 'The only thing I really remember is our vehicle been flipped on its side and a plume of black smoke filling the air. 'We received covering fire from a vehicle behind us and all got out. We had a few bruises and one of the lads knackered his back but all in all it was a lucky escape.' Older brother Nathan was behind the wheel of a Mastiff . armoured vehicle when another IED exploded only three weeks later. Nathan said: 'The Mastiff vehicles are an immense piece of kit and undoubtedly saved our lives. 'Without them we’d have probably both been killed.' Blast: The two incidents occurred within three weeks of each other at the same location on a route between Nad Ali and Laskkar Gah .

The bomb exploded outside a compound housing a U.S. military contractor in the Afghan capital . Nathan was on his second tour of Afghanistan, while Craig on tour in the country for the first time. Nathan said: 'I would come up to his checkpoint every three to four days when we needed to re-supply them.

    "document": "(CNN) -- The woman hired to turn around Rutgers University's troubled athletic program came under renewed fire Tuesday after news emerged she was named in a sex discrimination lawsuit at the University of Louisville, according to court documents obtained Tuesday. The revelation that Julie Hermann was at the center of a discrimination lawsuit while working at the University of Louisville, according to the documents, came just days after a report that a group of University of Tennessee volleyball players accused her of verbal abuse when she coached them in the 1990s. Hermann's appointment as Rutgers athletic director came more than a month after a video of a Rutgers coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach's firing, the resignation of the school's athletic director and sharp criticism from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \"It is a new day,\" Hermann told reporters after being appointed. \"(The problem) is already fixed, and there is no one that doesn't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust.\" The allegations against Hermann have raised questions about whether the Newark, New Jersey, university properly vetted Hermann before hiring her. But Christie told New Jersey 101.5 radio that he spoke with the university's president and board chairman about the allegations and that he would not second-guess Rutgers' hiring of Hermann. \"I told them I had questions, and I was going to get answers to those questions,\" he said on the radio station's weekly \"Ask the Governor\" show on Tuesday. \"I have gotten answers to those questions.\" Rutgers, meanwhile, went on the defensive Tuesday, releasing a list of names and contacts for supporters of Hermann. It also put out a statement that said she was on the \"original list of candidates\" assembled by a search firm for the position. \"Julie also was among the group of candidates considered at each step of the search process from the beginning,\" the statement said. Hermann was named in a 2008 lawsuit filed by Mary Banker, an assistant track and field coach, who alleged she was the victim of sex discrimination by the head coach and then fired after she complained to Hermann and the university's human resources department, according to documents. Banker alleged in the complaint that when she told Hermann about the discrimination, which included offensive comments, she was praised. \"We're lucky to have you,\" Hermann allegedly said in an e-mail, according to court documents. A jury in Kentucky awarded Banker $300,000 in damages and lost wages, but it was overturned by an appeals court. Banker's attorney is appealing the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court, according to court documents. Hermann did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment. The University of Louisville, in state Supreme Court court filings, defended the firing, saying the evidence showed Banker was \"an abysmal coach and recruiter.\" Word of the Louisville lawsuit followed news first reported Sunday by a New Jersey newspaper, The Star-Ledger, that a group of former volleyball players at Tennessee accused Hermann of \"mental cruelty.\" In a letter written in 1997 and obtained by the newspaper, members of the team purportedly claimed that Hermann called players \"whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.\" Verbal abuse from Hermann became so intense, they claimed, that the team banded together to write the letter, calling the situation \"irreconcilable.\" After the team presented the letter to Hermann, she chose to stop coaching them, according to the newspaper's report. One former Tennessee volleyball player defended Hermann in a statement of support, which was released by Rutgers. \"You were tough no doubt but I knew you cared and I went from being a kid with a bad attitude who thought I was God's gift to athletics to the captain of my team,\" wrote Sonya Thomas, who played for Tennessee from 1992 to 1995. \"Your intensity helped me be mentally tough and it was exactly what I needed. None of it was abusive, mean spirited or demeaning.\" In a written statement released Monday, Hermann said her former students' comments are \"heartbreaking.\" She denied the allegations of abuse and vowed to push ahead in her new role. \"I was never notified of the reported letter outlining the concerns of some former athletes. However, I am truly sorry that some were disappointed during my tenure as coach,\" she said. \"For sure, I was an intense coach, but there is a vast difference between high intensity and abusive behavior.\" Hermann said her commitment to students' success has been firm throughout her career. Rutgers University President Robert L. Barchi said Monday that he stands by the school's choice. \"Rutgers was deliberative at every stage of this process,\" he said in a written statement. \"Over the course of the search, Julie's record established her as a proven leader in athletics administration with a strong commitment to academic success as well as athletic excellence, and a strong commitment to the well-being of student athletes.\" A University of Tennessee spokeswoman declined to comment. Louisville women's basketball coach Jeff Walz backed Hermann, his boss over the last six years. While he couldn't speak about what may or may not have happened at Tennessee, Walz said that in their time together at Louisville, he found Hermman to be \"a very good administrator who always put the student athletes' well-being first, no matter what situation it was.\" The Cardinals coach said he didn't see the uproar over Hermann coming, given his observations of her with him and his players. He credits her with helping put a solid system in place, so student athletes were in good hands from their first day on campus through to their graduation. \"(In) the six years that I had with her, she was very competent at what she does, how she handles situations, and how she treats the student athletes,\" Walz said. CNN's Greg Botelho, Aaron Cooper, John Berman, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jason Kessler, Laura Dolan and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide were unable to use Facebook and Instagram for around an hour today. Hackers from online group Lizard Squad have claimed they shut down the two sites at around 6am GMT - but Mark Zuckerberg's social media empire says it was just a technical fault. Both sites, which have a total of 1.5billion users, appeared with error messages in the United States, Europe and Asia for around an hour. The social media blackout also affected the dating mobile app Tinder, as well as AOL Instant Messenger and Hipchat. Scroll down for video . Hacked? Facebook and its stable-mate Instagram were down for an hour this morning after an alleged cyber attack . Statement: Instagram, the photo sharing site owned by Facebook, was also offline although they say it was caused by a technical fault . Facebook, which also owns Instagram, has denied they were hacked and blamed the outage on 'a change that affected our configuration systems'. There were claims online that the super-snowstorm that is over America's east coast may have knocked out its servers. While it was down Facebook said they were 'aware' of trouble accessing the site and added: 'We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.' A spokesman later added: 'Earlier today many people had trouble accessing Facebook and Instagram. This was not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems. Lizard Squad's Facebook page after claiming it hacked Sony Playstation and Xbox . The Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down the Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation online networks, hitting users on Christmas Day. The hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firms' poor security. The consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions. One of the most popular features of the consoles, for example, is the ability to play against friends and other users. While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. A message on the Xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were 'up and running'. Sony engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online, but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems, as thousands of users log back on. 'We moved quickly to fix the problem, and both services are back to 100 per cent for everyone.' An Instagram spokesman posted on Twitter: 'We're aware of an outage affecting Instagram and are working on a fix. Thank you for your patience.' There is no word at this time what is causing the outage, and whether or not it might have anything to do with the ongoing blizzard, which is expected to dump 36 inches of snow in parts of New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, where key servers are based. The headquarters of Facebook are located in Menlo Park, California - an area which has not been affected by the storm. The hashtag #facebookdown and #socialmeltdown2015 immediately started tending on Twitter, which remains operational. Facebook had 1.25 billion monthly active users at the end of September last year, while photo-sharing service Instagram has 300 million active monthly users uploading around 70 million photos per day. Andrew Pope, an engineer at Facebook, posted on to the Facebook Developer's website to alert app creators to the 'major outage' which he said lasted up to an hour between around 6.10am and 7.10am. 'Our engineers identified the cause of the outage and recovered the site quickly,' he wrote. 'Thank you for your patience. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you and the users of your apps.' The Lizard Squad is a group of hackers that has caused havoc in the online world before, taking credit for attacks that took down the Sony PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live network last month. This morning the group tweeted 'Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, AIM, Hipchat £offline £LizardSquad'. Previously it claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day attack on Xbox and PlayStation games consoles which saw online services disabled. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, one of the group's hackers, who called himself 'member one', said he enjoyed identifying weaknesses in the web security of global companies. 'I wouldn't call myself a top-grade hacker - I know people who are way better than me. It's fair to say I know my stuff though,' he said. 'With me, when people, friends of mine, go out clubbing, partying, I didn't enjoy it so I decided to sit at home and learn more skills of my own. 'Maybe this isn't something most people enjoy and think it was a good decision but for us it was something that we just decided upon.' He added that 'huge, global companies' with teams of technicians should be able to protect their network security from hackers who have 'barely lived'. Previous: Yesterday the Lizard Squad claimed they had brought down the Malaysia Airlines website . Blank: Millions who tried to log on to Facebook and Instagram saw these blank screens this morning . The latest outage sparked panic online, but the majority retained a sense of humour . Another user Gino Quillamor wrote: 'Now that facebook is down, I might actually have to ask people how they're feeling in real life. 'What's on your mind?'' Rob Lee joked: 'If Facebook & Instagram are down how am I supposed to know what my aunt had for dinner or if any of my friends held a Starbucks cup today???' On a more serious note, less than 30 minutes into the shutdown, a hacker group known as the Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for the outage. In August, it also tweeted to American Airlines that there might be explosives on a plane carrying the president of Sony Online Entertainment, which makes video games, forcing the flight to be diverted. Yesterday, it claimed to have targeted The Malaysia Airlines website, leaving a message saying '404 Plane Not Found' and declaring it part of their 'cyber caliphate' Users logging on to the site of Malaysia's national carrier were greeted with the picture of a lizard in a top hat, monocle and tuxedo, smoking a pipe. The image was surrounded by the message '404 Plane Not Found', an apparent reference to the airlines' unexplained loss of flight MH370 last year with 239 people aboard. The extent of any links with the Islamic State, however, are not yet known. The jihadist group has seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq in a brutal campaign and declared an independent Islamic 'caliphate'. It also has used social media to recruit and spread its message. Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as 'vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious'. The group seeks to cause mayhem online 'for a laugh' and has called itself the 'next generation Grinch' after the children's character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks. Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the 'dark web'. Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause 'havoc'. Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: 'If they're coming after you, you're going to have a bad day.'",

A pair of identical twins, who became famous through their desperate battle with anorexia, have died in a house fire. Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer, 42, were killed after a fire broke out in their home in Geelong, near Melbourne, one perishing in the flames, the other succumbing to her severe burns on the way to hospital. It was a tragic end to two turbulent lives, for the sisters had appeared on Australian TV several times to talk about the anorexia which had turned both into virtual living skeletons and a problem pair for their parents, social workers and the police. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Identical twins Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer, 42, died when fire swept through their home in Geelong, near Melbourne .

In a poignant review of their lives they said in recent years that they had never been in love, never had a job and they believed that it was only a matter of time before they died – and they would die together. Their deaths in the fire are believed to have been accidental, according to detectives from the Geelong Crime Investigation Unit who said that initial checks did not reveal any suspicious activity. Yet there had been reports over the years of the women each trying to kill one another. Rachel was charged with the attempted . murder of Clare after police, who were called to their home, claimed . they witnessed Rachel with her hands locked around her sister’s throat. The charge was later withdrawn. Their existence, balanced between . life and death, had resulted in TV companies searching them out for . interviews after authorities considered jailing them in an attempt to . stop the women starving themselves to death and ‘turn their lives . around.’ In fact Clare . was later jailed by a Geelong court for a series of thefts – but only . after magistrate Ian von Einem said he saw no option but to send her to . prison to stop her from self-destructing. Her . sister also presented a headache for the authorities when she was . arrested for driving under the influence of drugs and was also accused . of pushing a victim on to train tracks. She received a 21-month suspended . jail sentence. The . women, who were compulsive long-distance runners, described themselves . as perfectionists in biomedical science and physical education, topics . they studied avidly, side by side. But as they started to waste away . over two decades, the weight of each of them dropped to little more than . four stone. Doctors said they had the bone structure of women aged . between 70 and 100.

Accused: NFL star Aaron Hernandez was confined to his cell when the play-off game was on . Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez who is currently in jail on a murder charge has been prevented from watching his team's play-off victory. Tough rules at Bristol County House of Correction in Boston meant Hernandez was not allowed to watch the televised game. He was confined to his cell when the crucial AFC Divisional Round match was on, Bristol Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson revealed. Sheriff Hodgson told the Boston Herald: 'He's not allowed to watch any TV. It’s jail. It’s all about standards and sending a message. 'We only allow two hours a day of entertainment television.' Inmates are only allowed to watch self-help tapes and self-help documentaries, according to the strict prison guidelines. Hernandez, who is prevented from mixing with other inmates due to his high-profile . status, is allowed three hours exercised a day in a 12ft eight foot enclosure. The 24-year-old is on remand in the high-security prison after being charged . with murdering Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional football player who was found shot dead near his Massachusetts home in June. Prosecutors claim that Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. In September, 2013, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to murder. He is also now a suspect in the 2012 double-murder of two men outside a Boston night club. Authorities believe that the June 17 . murder of Lloyd is in some way related to the double-murder of . Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were fatally shot outside of the . Cure Lounge in Boston on July 16, 2012. The new developments in the case were detailed in a search warrant released in Superior Court in Bristol, last month. Hard-hitting: New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount (29) breaks free from Indianapolis Colts safety LaRon Landry (30) Missing out: Former team player Aaron Hernandez was not allowed to watch New England Patriots beat Indianapolis Colts . According to the warrant, police say Hernandez and friend Alexander Bradley - who later sued Hernandez, claiming that he shot him in the face last February - were at the Cure Lounge on the night of the double-murder. It previously has been reported that Hernandez, who was on a $40 million contract with the Patriots when he was charged, and his friends fought with Abreau, Furtado and their friends prior to the shooting. However, there is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently released warrant, which was first obtained by the Hartford Courant. Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel Abreu, right, were killed after getting in an altercation in a club in 2012 . Scene: The men were killed as they drove from the club with other friends on July 15, 2012 . According to the warrant, authorities believe Hernandez and Bradley were in a silver SUV that circled the block outside of the Cure Lounge, apparently waiting for Abreau and Furtado to leave. When the men left with their friends about 2.30am, the silver Toyota SUV pulled up next to the gray BMW were in and someone opened fire. The warrant does not specify whether authorities think Hernandez was the trigger man. The warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the double-murder after a detective investigating Lloyd's death - who also investigated the murders of Abreau and Furtado - remembered seeing Hernandez at the Cure Lounge while reviewing surveillance footage from the club taken the night of the murders. Additionally, authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the Rumor nightclub - where Hernandez and Lloyd had been seen arguing two days prior to Lloyd's murder - who claimed to have information indicating that the Lloyd murder and the double-murder at the Cure Lounge were related. According to the warrant, Rumor security guard Sharif Hashem called the North Attleborough police department on June 22 - just days after Lloyd's murder - and said someone had 'accidentally spilled the beans' about the connection between the three murders in front of him. The combination of the tip and the detective's recollection of seeing Hernandez at the club where Abreau and Furtado were murdered caused authorities to reopen the investigation into the double-murder.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- An Australian high court ruled Friday that a quadriplegic man has the right to refuse food and water and can be allowed to die, a rare legal finding that some see as a major victory for right-to-die campaigners. An Australian high court ruled Friday that Christian Rossiter has the right to refuse food and water. The ruling means that the nursing facility in which Christian Rossiter has lived since November 2008 cannot be held criminally liable for allowing the patient to die, the Supreme Court of Western Australia said. \"I'm happy that I won my right to die,\" Rossiter, 49, said afterward. But he added that he will further consult with a doctor because he may change his mind. A leading Australian right-to-die advocate called the ruling a significant victory. \"I don't know that many people will want to die this way. But for people who do, it's a very important decision,\" said Dr. Philip Nitschke, founder and director of Exit International, a leading global voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life advocacy group. Nitschke noted that Rossiter's case is significant because his mind is fully functional. \"This is the first time that it's come up with a person that's rational and lucid,\" Nitschke told CNN. \"This is unusual. It's very rare.\" Chief Justice Wayne Martin noted that distinction in his order, saying, \"Mr. Rossiter is not a child, nor is he terminally ill, nor dying. He is not in a vegetative state, nor does he lack the capacity to communicate his wishes. There is therefore no question of other persons making decisions on his behalf. \"Rather, this is a case in which a person with full mental capacity and the ability to communicate his wishes has indicated that he wishes to direct those who have assumed responsibility for his care to discontinue the provision of treatment which maintains his existence.\" Some family and right-to-life groups opposed Rossiter's request. \"Really, what we should be doing is looking after each other rather than facilitating an escape,\" John Barich of the Australian Family Association said in a TV interview. Peter O'Meara, president of Western Australia's Right to Life Association, said, \"The law which is being applied can be a dangerous precedent.\" Rossiter has suffered a series of injuries since 1988 that have left him with limited foot movement and the ability to wriggle only one finger. He is fed through a stomach tube. He relies on staff at the Brightwater Care Group nursing facility in the city of Perth for such routine care as regular turning, cleaning, assistance with bowel movements, physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology. Australian law gives patients the right to refuse life-saving treatment, but helping someone commit suicide is a crime that can carry a life prison sentence. The Brightwater nursing facility sought the ruling to make sure it would not be held liable if it complied with Rossiter's request to stop all nutrition and hydration, except to be given enough liquid to make it possible to take pain medication. Rossiter attended the hearing in a wheelchair, breathing through a tracheotomy tube in his throat. He told the judge he wants to die. It's a point he has been making publicly. \"I can't move,\" Rossiter said in a televised interview this week. \"I can't even wipe the tears from my eyes. And I'd like to die. I'm imprisoned in my own body. I have no fear of death. Just pain.\" Rossiter pointed out in a recent interview with the PerthNow news outlet that he once led an active life. \"This is living hell,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I used to be a cyclist, I used to be a keen walker. I bushwalked around the world. ... I've rock climbed in Yosemite Valley in California up very steep cliffs. I've got a degree in economics and now I can't even read a newspaper, I can't turn the pages.\" Rossiter joined the Exit International right-to-death organization about three months ago, said Nitschke, who talked with him before the hearing. Nitschke said Rossiter appeared \"very happy\" afterward. A Brightwater executive said the company appreciates that the court's ruling has relieved the nursing facility of any liability. \"The whole organization has been most concerned for Mr. Rossiter but also concerned for our own legal standing and this has clarified things greatly,\" said Penny Flett, the company's chief executive. While hailing the victory, Nitschke decried the fact that Rossiter will have to undergo a slow and painful death through starvation, rather than having a quicker and painless way to end his life. Because he cannot use his hands, Rossiter must rely on others to withhold treatment rather than being able to take his own life. Switzerland has an assisted suicide law, and Rossiter has considered going there. \"It's a bit sad that the best that Australia can come up with,\" Nitschke said, \"is that we can let a person like that starve to death.\"",
    "summary": "Series of accidents in 1988 left Christian Rossiter unable to live normally . Rossiter: \"I can't even wipe the tears from my eyes\" Ruling means nursing facility cannot be held liable for allowing him to die . Critics fear the ruling will set a dangerous precedent ."

    "document": "(Mashable) -- After initially dismissing the reports about the iPhone 4 antenna reception issue, Apple has officially admitted it exists, promising a software fix in a couple of weeks. There's a catch, though. Apple's promised fix may not be good news for users experiencing the problem. Apple claims it has erroneously calculated the formula which displays signal bars on the iPhone, and therefore the iPhone has been showing too many bars in areas with weak signal strength. Here's how Apple explains it: . \"Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place.\" Unfortunately, this seems like Apple is only acknowledging one part of the problem. Anandtech's in-depth analysis showed that the signal drop when you grip the iPhone 4 by its lower-right side is very real. Therefore, Apple's fix probably won't fix that part -- arguably the biggest part -- of the problem, and will merely make the iPhone 4 display fewer bars in weak signal areas. Interestingly enough, Apple claims the miscalculation was present \"since the original iPhone,\" so the fix will apply to older generation iPhones as well. Here's Apple's official announcement: . Dear iPhone 4 Users, . The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in Apple's history. It has been judged by reviewers around the world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them. Here is what we have learned. To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by one or more bars. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop four or five bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design. At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our own experience and testing. What can explain all of this? We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising. Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display four bars when we should be displaying as few as two bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying four or five bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place. To fix this, we are adopting AT&T's recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the iPhone's bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a given area. We are also making bars one, two and three a bit taller so they will be easier to see. We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been present since the original iPhone, this software update will also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G. We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same- the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused. As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund. We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do. Thank you for your patience and support. Apple . © 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.",

    "document": "TV host Mårten Andersson, 40, is launching the club night in Stockholm this September called SOBER . It's the same story every Saturday and Sunday morning as millions of Brits wake up nursing stupendous hangovers. 12 hours earlier as punters in bars, nightclubs and restaurants they will have been queuing up to hand over their hard-earned cash in return for enough booze to get drunk out of their minds. Now one man is hoping to change this centuries-old tradition with the invention of a new type watering hole: an alcohol-free nightclub. Mårten Andersson, 40, is launching a club night in Stockholm this September called SOBER, that will only stock soft drinks and promises to bar entry to drunk guests. The Swedish TV host and comedian decided to launch the evening to help people change their relationship with alcohol. He came up with the idea after quitting alcohol himself seven months ago. He told the MailOnline: 'I love what happened to me when I stopped drinking - I had been talking about doing it for some time, because I had started to feel anxiety when I drank. 'Then I was out partying one weekend, got too drunk and just decided to take a break. 'It was only supposed to be for a month, but then I realised that on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I was usually still feeling the effects of a hangover, so I was basically wasting half of my week. 'I'm not an alcoholic, so I will probably drink again at some point because I really enjoy the taste of wine, but my attitude to drinking has now changed.' Mårten now socialises completely without alcohol and reckons he has never had a better time - dancing more and having more confidence to meet people when he goes out. He is convinced that there are many more people like him, who would enjoy clubbing without being under the influence, they just don't know it yet. He said: 'Around 95 per cent of the people who I've told about my idea have been really positive, but they are also very curious about a lot of things, like how it would work financially and whether it will be boring, or will people dance. 'Well I can tell you that I have never danced so much as I do now that I am sober. 'And each time you go out without drinking, you come home and realise that you have become more confident in doing things like talking to people. Late-night drunken queasiness could soon be a thing of the past if alcohol-free club nights catch on . 'Because you no longer need the alcohol for confidence - you can do it on its own.' The theory is that we really only get drunk most of the time out of habit, because we are so used to drinking alcohol with social activities that it becomes second nature. Mårten said: 'If you want to drink, then drink. But don't just do it on auto-pilot because it's what you have always done. 'I just made a change because my therapist said that we often associate everything with alcohol. 'So going to a football game - you drink, going bowling - you drink, meeting up with friends - you drink. 'This club is a way of making people discover themselves without those toxins.' Mårten is going out of his way to make sure that the club night won't feel like one of the main elements is lacking, with bartenders and mixologists creating and sourcing all of the alcohol-free drinks so that they will hopefully taste just as good as normal alcoholic beverages. He said: 'If you're a person who doesn't drink alcohol normally, you're doomed to second class drinks. The SOBER club night will provide alcohol-free drinks that aim to taste as good as normal boozy beverages like wine, beer and champagne . 'You get these horrible sugary juices or a lemonade and lime fizzy thing that is so boring, because you are no use to the bar if you are not drinking because they won't make any money out of you. 'But we are going to focus on lovingly made alcohol-free drinks - you can get some great beers and cocktails that don't need alcohol. 'There is even great tasting alcohol-free champagne that comes in a beautiful bottle, so you will still have all of the extras that usually would come with the alcohol. 'And it will be exactly like a normal club, with great DJ's, good music, good drinks, a nice venue and maybe even go-go dancers, it just won't have drunk people in it.' And if it's so good that drunk people want to also try and get in, they won't be allowed. Mårten believes the dance floor at his SOBER club night will be even more packed than a normal club. He said: 'I dance more now than I ever used to when i was drinking.' Bouncers on the door will be given breathalysers to weed out any punters who deny they've been on the sauce and anyone who does manage to sneak in will be booted out if discovered. Mårten said: 'That may sound a bit harsh, but if they are drinking then they can go to any of the other 99.9 per cent of clubs available that do sell alcohol. 'This is a place for people who don't want people drunkenly coming on to them or bumping into them. 'To be honest though, if they were drunk I don't think they would want to come in because they would feel stupid, they would be the only ones who were and everyone would be looking at them.' If anyone is doubting whether the night will be a success, they only need to look at the number of tickets sold for the first event on September 26 at Kägelbanan in Stockholm. 600 of the 750 tickets available have already sold out, with five weeks to go. Early morning club workout sessions called 'Morning Glory' where music-lovers are encouraged to rave their way into the day . The trend for raves without booze are building in popularity in the UK too, with early morning dance club workouts called 'Morning Glory' having huge success in London. Although whether the events would have the same popularity if they took place at night is yet to be seen. Mårten said: 'The world is ready for an alternative, there are a lot of us who would enjoy going out without being surrounded by p****heads. 'And if it is a success, this isn't just going to be a club night, it will hopefully be bigger than that. 'SOBER will hopefully be a whole project, an inspiration. 'I'd like to see it as a community, where we could do lectures and try to inspire people to start thinking about how they are drinking and also how they live their lives. 'Then maybe start a restaurant without alcohol, that is fair trade and ecological. I have connections in the UK too through my comedy work, so I could always try it there too.' Carefree raving is easy after one too many mojitos, but what about when you're sober? Writer TONI JONES tried the new urban fitness trend for health and beauty siteGetTheGloss.com. Toni and her friend George Bear raving their way into the day . She says: 'It's not unheard of for me to find myself in the middle of a sweaty dance floor as the sun comes up. Some of my best memories involve dancing till dawn with my most glamorous gal pals. What is unheard of is for me to be doing it completely sober. 'Morning Gloryville is billed as an 'immersive morning experience' encouraging dance fans to rave their way into the day, without drink, drugs or judgement. The team behind the 'conscious clubbing' movement claim that a dance-based, totally clean wake-up call is the most fun way to work out and get endorphins flowing. 'On the day, after a slow-ish start where the amount of harem pants and bongos had me worried that the sober scene was a little too alternative for me, my friends and I surprised ourselves by really getting into the swing of things. 'By 8am the dance floor was packed with glamorous young (ish) men and women raving their heads off to noughties dance anthems and the crowd seemed better looking than average (which was probably more to do with the fact they were at the start of their day not the end rather than the non-drinking aspect), everyone had a big grin on their faces, and we worked up a real sweat bouncing around. 'One problem with morning raving (sober or drunk) is trying to make yourself office appropriate in a nightclub loo. And I'm not sure Morning Glory would work at the weekend if trying to compete with real booze-addled after parties. But it's definitely a fun way to work out, and a great excuse to wear sequins before 9am.'",

Chesley Sullenberger is an Air Force veteran who has been with US Airways since 1980. Sullenberger has a cool, calm and collected style -- honed by decades of flight experience and research on safety issues, friend and neighbor John Walberg told the Contra Costa Times newspaper. All 155 passengers and crew aboard Flight 1549 survived. The 57-year-old former Air Force fighter pilot has been flying for more than 40 years, and has been with US Airways since 1980. His two-page resume is packed with achievements and highlights his broad aviation experience. The pilot speaks internationally on airline safety, and collaborates with the Center for Catastrophic Risk Management at the University of California-Berkeley, whose researchers look for ways to avoid air disasters. Watch a pilot applaud Sullenberger's skills » . Passenger Joe Hart praised the plane's crew as \"phenomenal, in all respects.\" \"Once the pilot said 'brace for impact,' the flight attendants made sure everybody knew they had to be buckled in and bent over,\" Hart said. \"Then they sat in their chairs, strapped themselves in, and in a regular cadence, until we hit the water, they just continued to chant 'brace, brace, brace' so that nobody would sit up. And that, I think, helped prevent a lot of injuries on impact.\" CNN affiliate WKOW in Madison, Wisconsin, identified the co-pilot as Jeffrey Skiles, 49. Barbara Skiles told WKOW that, in conversations since the incident, her husband has praised the rescue effort. \"He was really grateful and really impressed about the response that they got, how quickly boats were at the side of the airplane,\" she said. Sullenberger was primed to help passengers aboard the Airbus A320 survive the crisis, said Karlene Roberts, a university professor who co-directs the center. \"I can imagine him being sufficiently in charge to get those people out,\" she said. \"He's got that kind of personality, which is to his credit.\" Watch how passengers call pilot a hero » . Sullenberger's resume is packed with achievements. After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1973, he had a brief but distinguished Air Force career during which he flew the Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom fighter jet. He was a flight leader and training officer with experience in Europe and the Pacific and at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, where he was the mission commander for Red Flag exercises. The exercises are for advanced aerial combat training, a position delegated to top pilots. Among those who congratulated Sullenberger was Lt. Gen. John Regni, the Air Force Academy superintendent, who graduated with Sullenberger. \"He not only showcased unbelievable airmanship, but exemplary character as well,\" Regni said. \"In addition to superb judgment under utmost pressure, by checking his aircraft twice to ensure there were no passengers left behind he epitomized the 'service before self' concept we strive to instill in our cadets,\" Regni said. Sullenberger is president and CEO of Safety Reliability Methods Inc., a company he founded. The firm provides emergency management, safety strategies and performance monitoring to the aviation industry. He was an instructor and Air Line Pilots Association safety chairman, accident investigator and national technical committee member, according to a biography on the Web site of his company. He participated in several U.S. Air Force and National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations, and worked with NASA scientists on a paper on error and aviation, according to his resume. He was widely praised after Thursday's forced water landing, apparently caused by a \"double bird strike,\" which crippled the plane's engines. \"It was an amazing piece of airmanship,\" said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. Even New York's mayor had praise. \"It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out,\" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference Thursday. \"I had a long conversation with the pilot. He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board -- and assures us there was not.\" Sullenberger's wife, Lorrie, told CNN that his response wasn't surprising. \"This is the Sully I know, she said. \"I always knew this is how he would react. So, to me, this is not something unusual.

    "document": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Thirty-eight years ago, Joseph McGinty Nichol was a boy in Kalamazoo, Michigan, playing with toy robots. Many of the robots in \"Terminator Salvation\" are real machines, which increased realism, the cast says. Today \"McG,\" as he is better known, builds and blows up real robots. The prominent filmmaker is the driving force behind one of the season's summer blockbusters, \"Terminator Salvation,\" which is filled with very expensive and very explosive robots. The choice to use real robots when possible, instead of CGI (computer generated images), was deliberate, McG said. According to the director and the film's stars, the decision to use real machines was a testament to the growing sophistication of the moviegoing public, whom they believe can \"feel\" the difference between actors standing in front of a green screen versus actors interacting with the real thing. It was also done in honor of the legendary special effects supervisor, four-time Oscar winner Stan Winston (\"Jurassic Park,\" the other \"Terminator\" films), who passed away during filming last year. Watch the robots in action » . The director and three of his cast members -- Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard and Anton Yelchin -- took a time out with CNN to explain why gravity and singed eyebrows both played a role in \"Terminator Salvation.\" Bryce Dallas Howard: That was something that was really important to McG ... when an audience member sees this film, that they can actually feel what's occurring. I think that audiences are very savvy now. We can feel when something is CGI and that's no disrespect to CGI -- we couldn't do this movie without it -- but, whenever possible, in the tradition of Sam Winston, he wanted to build the robots. So a lot of what you see is real. McG: And if you drop something, we've spent our whole lives watching physics in play, and if you say, just have the CGI do that, people can tell something's off, and it releases you from being involved in the picture. So, we built all the robots, we built all the sets, we blew them up for real, a great many of us lost our eyebrows! Christian Bale: It was kind of comical at times because something that's meant to be so intimidating was actually surrounded by five guys with these kind of puppet rods I had to blank out or I would start laughing. But, the end result is something really formidable and you know, really iconic in movie history. Anton Yelchin: Now I'm obsessed with the robots!

    "document": "Beijing, China (CNN) -- China on Tuesday stepped up criticism of Norway and the awarding of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a leading Chinese dissident. Liu is serving an 11-year prison term after repeatedly calling for human rights and democratization. \"The Norwegian Nobel committee's decision to give Liu the Nobel Peace Prize will damage bilateral relations. There is reason for every Chinese person to be unhappy,\" Ma Zhaoxu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news briefing. \"We already made our position clear. Since reform and opening up, China has made remarkable progress,\" Ma said. \"By giving a convicted person the Nobel Peace Prize, they show no respect for China's judicial system.\" \"It not only disrespects China, but also reveals their true intentions. If you try to change China's political system from the outside, or if they are trying to stop Chinese people from moving forward, that is obviously making a mistake,\" he added. Liu was sentenced in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Asked about Liu's wife, Liu Xia, Ma responded: \"I do not know who you are talking about. I am not familiar with this person.\" Liu Xia remains under house arrest in Beijing and has been banned from talking to friends or media, Liu Xiaobo's lawyer said. She is trying to visit the attorney to discuss an appeal to her husband's sentence. \"She is negotiating with the police on the terms of the visit,\" Shang Baojun, the lawyer, told CNN. \"The issue of an appeal is not if, but when and how.\" Shang confirmed that Liu Xia said her husband wanted her to go to Oslo to accept the award in December, but he is not optimistic about the prospect. \"It's way too early to think about her Norway trip, considering she can't even leave her house,\" he said.

    "document": "A respiratory virus that has sent hundreds of children to hospitals in Missouri is causing alarm across the Midwest and beyond. Ten states have contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for help investigating clusters of the virus that's being blamed for the illness. List of states with the Enterovirus . Health officials say they're still figuring out what's going on. The bug that appears to be causing most of the concern has a typically arcane name -- Enterovirus EV-D68 -- but many of its symptoms are very common. Here's what you need to know about the virus. What are enteroviruses? Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual. They're actually very common. When you have a bad summer cold, often what you have is an enterovirus, said Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Viral Diseases. There are more than 100 types of enteroviruses causing about 10 to 15 million infections in the United States each year, according to the CDC. They are carried in the intestinal tract and often spread to other parts of the body. The season often hits its peak in September, as summer ends and fall begins. Why Enterovirus infections are difficult to track . So why all the concern now? What's unusual at the moment is the high number of hospitalizations. The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said. \"It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care. I would call it unprecedented,\" said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, a director for infectious diseases at Children's Mercy Hospital, where about 475 children were recently treated. \"I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,\" she said. What parents should know about EV-D68 . What's special about this particular type of enterovirus? An analysis by the CDC showed at least 30 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68, Missouri health officials said. It's a type of enterovirus that's uncommon, but not new. It was first identified in the 1960s and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time. But it's possible, Pallansch said, that the relatively low number of reports might be because EV-D68 is hard to identify. EV-D68 was seen last year in the United States and this year in various parts of the world. Over the years, clusters have been reported in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and various countries including the Philippines, Japan and the Netherlands. Experts say they don't know why it's flared up this time around. \"Why one virus or another crops up in one part of the country or another part of the country from one year to the next is inexplicable,\" said William Schaffner, head of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"It's a mystery to me.\" What are the symptoms? The virus can start as just a cold. Signs include coughing, difficulty breathing and in some cases a rash. Sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing. Respiratory problems appear to the hallmark of EV-D68, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. \"Most enteroviruses cause either a little bit of a cold or a diarrheal illness -- a few cause meningitis,\" said Schaffner. \"This one is the, if you will, odd cousin. It causes prominent respiratory symptoms. Why it does that, we're really not sure.\" How serious is it? The good news is that enteroviruses usually aren't deadly. \"All of these folks are going to get better,\" said Schaffner. \"Some of them have more severe illness, such as these children who have developed asthma and are hospitalized. But they should all get better.\" Many of the EV-D68 infections \"will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,\" the Missouri health agency said. Some cases could, in theory, contribute to death, but none of the Missouri cases have resulted in death and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States, the agency said. How widespread are the cases? Beyond the surge in infections in Missouri, there are signs of a possible regional outbreak of EV-D68. Colorado, Illinois and Ohio are reporting cases with similar symptoms and are awaiting testing results, according to officials and CNN affiliates in those states. The 10 states that have reached out to the CDC for assistance are Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. The unusually high number of hospitalizations reported now could be \"just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases,\" said Pallansch of the CDC. What can be done to prevent it? Like other enteroviruses, the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people. That makes children more susceptible. There's not a great deal you can do, health officials say, beyond taking commonsense steps to reduce the risk. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds -- particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people, such as toys and doorknobs. Avoid shaking hands, kissing, hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick. And stay home if you feel unwell. There's no vaccine for EV-D68.",
    "summary": "Enterovirus EV-D68 is uncommon but not new . It causes prominent respiratory symptoms, like a cold but worse . People suffering from the disease should all get better, an expert says . Enteroviruses are very common, causing up to 15 million infections a year in the U.S."

    "document": "Monica Lewinsky is reportedly set to write a tell-all book about her affair with Bill Clinton - including her intimate love letters to the ex-president and how he had an insatiable desire for threesomes. The former White House intern, 39, reportedly wants revenge on Clinton, who she believes escaped unscathed while she has never been able to shake the disgrace of their Oval Office trysts. Friends claim publishers are scrambling to get their hands on the book, and after holding meetings, she has learned she could get as much a $12 million if she recounts every tawdry detail. While she has not yet secured a book deal, her apparent attempts to cash in on the affair could rattle the Clinton marriage - and wreck Hillary's bid for the presidency in 2016. Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky is reportedly writing a $12 million tell-all book about her affair with Clinton . Speaking to the National Enquirer, her friends said the memoir could . even spark further health problems for the former . president, who has undergone heart surgeries. 'Her book could be more than just revenge, it could kill him!' a source said. Her bids for a book deal will at least shake Clinton - bringing him crashing down from the success he enjoyed after an energetic speech at the Democratic National Convention earlier this month. 'Monica has tried to move forward, but the nightmare of her affair with Bill still haunts her,' a friend told the Enquirer. 'She’s facing 40 without a man in her life, and seething about the way her reputation was destroyed as the whole world watched.' The book will also include never-before-seen love letters that she wrote to the president - some of which were so intimate she never sent them, another friend added. They reportedly detail her love for . Clinton and how Lewinsky, then just 22, could make him much happier than . his wife, Hillary, who the president called a 'cold fish'. Admiration: A December 1996 White House photo shows Clinton and Lewinsky at a Christmas party . Affair: Lewinsky, pictured in November 1995, claimed she had nine sexual encounters with President Clinton in the Oval Office between November 1995 and March 1997 . Centre of a scandal: In October 1996, Clinton embraces Lewinsky, then a White House intern . He also laughed about his nonexistent sex life with his wife - and said he thought he was not the only one looking for love outside their marriage. 'Monica can describe how Bill went on . and on about his insatiable desire for three-way sex, orgies and the use . of sex toys of all kinds,' the friend added. As . well as the heartbreak she suffered after her relationship with Clinton, Lewinsky . also plans to detail the pain of ending a pregnancy at the height of her . liaison with the president, the source said. She . was carrying a child fathered by a Pentagon employee called 'Thomas', . she revealed in an earlier biography written by Andrew Morton. 'That . void has never been filled,' said the friend. She . decided to develop the memoir after her sullied reputation meant she . struggled to find work but realised she would get a generous offer for the book. Denial: With his wife standing by in January 1998, Clinton insists he did not have relations with 'that woman' Truth: But in August 1998, Clinton confessed on television that he did have sexual relations with her . She is also writing it to get revenge on Clinton, now 66, friends said. 'For years, Monica tried to protect . Bill out of a misplaced sense of loyalty,' a source told the Enquirer. 'But she no . longer feels that way, and her memoir is his worst nightmare.' During her grand jury testimony . against Clinton in 1998, an immunity deal prevented her from exposing . intimate details about their affair in the Morton expose that came out that . year. 'But that agreement expired in 2001, and . when Bill published his autobiography My Life three years later, . Monica felt betrayed by him all over again,' said the source. In the wake of the scandal, Lewinsky became the centre of a political storm and gave a series of high-profile interviews. But unable to escape the shake the reputation, she moved to England in 2005 where she earned her master's degree and worked as a news correspondent for the UK's Channel Five News. 'Nightmare': Lewinsky's friends believe the book could rock Clinton's marriage to Hillary, left, who he called a 'cold fish' during the affair. They are also pictured with daughter Chelsea . Though it has been 14 years since she claimed she had nine sexual encounters with the president, her presence still looms in the life of Clinton's post-presidency and Hillary's political career. In what was an unfortunate and awkward schedule at the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina earlier this month, Lewinsky's former rabbi - who publicly condemned Clinton during the sex scandal - gave the benediction minutes after the former President took the stage. ABC News reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by organizers because Rabbi David Wolpe is such a well-known figure in the Jewish community. And in July, during a visit to Egypt as U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was taunted by her husband's affair by protesters as they chanted 'Monica, Monica!'",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Despite President Barack Obama's signing of a law repealing the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent a memo to troops warning them that it remains in effect until 60 days after the government certifies that the military is ready for implementation. The Pentagon says it does not know how long the certification process may take. In the meantime, Gates is essentially telling gays and lesbians serving in the military not to come out until 60 days after that determination is made. \"In order to prevent any confusion, I want to be perfectly clear: at this time, there are no new changes to any existing Department or Service policies,\" said the memo, released Thursday. \"Service members who alter their personal conduct during this period may face adverse consequences,\" Gates wrote. Before the ban is completely lifted, the president, the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness. Since October, the military has dismissed at least eight service members for violations of the policy, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan. But Lapan said those dismissals had been approved prior to Oct. 21, when Gates tightened the rules about who in the Pentagon can dismiss a service member for violating the policy. Now, only the civilian service secretaries, in consultation with the Pentagon's top lawyer and head of personnel, can order dismissals. No new cases have resulted in dismissals since then. Gates also said he now endorses all the recommendations of the Pentagon's working group on \"don't ask, don't tell\" as the road map for implementation. There will be no special bathroom or housing facilities to accommodate homosexuals, except in special cases. And troops who oppose serving with homosexuals will not be allowed to quit the military before their commitment is up.",

    "document": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A couple of years ago, Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas declared that it was time to undertake \"an audit of my life.\" Now, at the age of 92, he's going public with the results. Kirk Douglas, now 92, recently starred in a one-man show about his life and work. Douglas takes an unsparing look at his personal life and career in his one-man show, \"Before I Forget,\" which just completed its run at a theater that bears his name in Culver City, California. Over the course of the 1½-hour show, he delved into his brushes with death (a helicopter-plane collision that claimed two lives, his suicidal thoughts after a stroke in 1994); the death of his youngest son, Eric (from an accidental drug overdose in 2004); his troubled relationship with a father who could never express his love for him; and his key role in smashing the Hollywood blacklist of the 1950s. Douglas plans to turn the show into a TV special and DVD, with the proceeds benefiting the Motion Picture and Television Home, where he endowed a wing named for his father, Harry. He invited CNN to his home in Beverly Hills to discuss his show and what he's learned about himself over the course of a life that began in 1916 in Amsterdam, New York, as Issur Danielovitch. Watch Douglas reflect on his life » . Below is an edited version of his remarks. Kirk Douglas: All my life, I have taken inventory at intervals. For example, when I became a movie actor and suddenly I had to deal with fame, money and playing so many roles, I lost myself. I said, \"Who am I?\" And I wrote my first book to deal with that, \"The Ragman's Son.\" Then the next thing that happened: I was in a helicopter crash. We crashed into a small plane with two young people who were killed instantly. I fell to the ground, and I said, \"Why?\" I tried to find God, so I wrote a book, \"Climbing the Mountain.\" Then the worst accident in my life happened with a tingling across my cheek, and then it developed into a stroke, and I couldn't talk, and an actor who can't talk is a big problem. But then I wrote the book \"My Stroke of Luck\" that helped me and helped a lot of other people. That was gratifying. After that, here I was, 92 years old, impediment in my speech, and was reflecting on my life, and people thought I would write another book, and I said no, I'm going to do a one-man show. My friends laughed; they thought it was a joke, but I did it. CNN: You are brutally honest in your show. Did you ever hesitate and think, \"this is too personal, and maybe I shouldn't do this?\" Douglas: Well, listen, I'm an actor; I have made my living by acting, and I almost think I owe it to the public to express my feelings and not as a character on a screen but as myself. CNN: What kind of reaction did you get from people? Douglas: Well, so many people cried, and I thought, you know, it's easy to make people cry, but it's more important to make people laugh. ... Especially in this world today, if you don't laugh, you cry. CNN: I was surprised at how much humor there was in the show. One of the lines that got laughs was when you described talking to an old actor friend of yours. You told him, \"I'm doing a one-man show,\" and he said ... Douglas: \"Is there any part in it for me?\" You know, actors are pathetic. We are desperate, you know, and an actor -- instead of like a writer, you can criticize their writing, an actor, you criticize him. It's very personal. It makes you very vulnerable. CNN: You speak of a long life and of your brushes with death, and you say it in a humorous way in the show, like, \"does God hate me?\" Douglas: I have so many things that were happening to me: the stroke, the helicopter crash, a broken back, I broke two knees, then I thought maybe God is mad at me. CNN: But in all seriousness, did you take any of this as a message from above? Douglas: Well, I don't know. I have studied religion, and I have concluded that there is some power. We don't understand it. Nobody really saw the Pearly Gates or hell. But I feel affected by nature. If I look at the trees, or the other day we got a bouquet of roses, and there were white roses tinted red, and I thought, \"How does that happen?\" So if you look at nature, you begin to think that there is some power behind everything. I don't know what it is, and I don't think anybody knows. You either have to believe that there is, or you don't. CNN: You've had a really interesting spiritual journey in your life, and you have explored your Judaism much more as you got older. Douglas: I studied Judaism a lot. I studied religion in general, and I have never imposed my Judaism on my kids. They are what they want to be. I think ... you must care for others. That's the correct religion, I think. You have to learn eventually to care for other people. My mother said once to me -- and we were very poor -- but my mother said, \"A beggar must give something to another beggar who is worse off than he.\" And that has stuck with me. ... If people give whatever they can give to help other people, we will solve all of the problems of the world. ... Being an actor is narcissistic, because you are the vehicle of the [character], but lately as I mature I realize you have to help people. ... I think I've been very lucky despite all of the accidents that I have had. ... I have a career that I'm proud of, and I think I owe something to the world that I grew up in. CNN: You played a key role in breaking the Hollywood blacklist by giving screen credit to Dalton Trumbo in 1960 for writing \"Spartacus.\" That's something that you look back on with a great sense of pride. Douglas: That is the thing that I'm most proud of, and I think it happened to me [at the right time]. I was young enough to be impulsive but mature enough to realize what I was doing. ... People would say, \"Hey, Kirk, are you crazy? You'll never work in Hollywood again.\" You know, I did it, and it's one thing that I will always be proud of. CNN: In the show, you talk very candidly about your relationship with your father and that yearning you had. Douglas: That moved a lot of people, and I didn't realize how many people identified with that. How many people didn't get the pat on the back that they wanted from their father? Not only men, I have had women tell me that. Amazing. CNN: In the show, you also talk about the loss of your son Eric and how painful that was for you. Douglas: Of course the death of Eric, my youngest son, was a tragedy. Everyone has a tragedy of some sort in their life, but when you lose a loved one, you never get over it. People try to help you, but they have no clue. It's always a sad part of your life, and you have to deal with it, after you get through the pain of thinking \"What did I do wrong?\" you know. You just have to accept it as part of life. CNN: I was intrigued by something you wrote in your most recent book, \"Let's Face It.\" You said, \"I like Issur more than I like Kirk Douglas.\" Douglas: Issur was my original name, and as I say in my one-man show ... I have to remember that. Like childhood actors, they get you to change your name. Kirk Douglas was not the essence of what I am. Issur is what I am, and I think that that's very important to remember. I like the fact that now lots of actors keep their ethnic names. ... You have to face reality, and I face reality by going back in my life to what I am. CNN: If you were an actor coming up now, would you have kept your given name? Douglas: I would try to, yes, of course. ... If I were a ballet dancer, Issur Danielovitch would be a wonderful name.",

A British holidaymaker has been slapped with a £4,000 bill for internet roaming charges after returning from a trip to America. Robin Baynes, 30, was charged £4,180.83 despite buying a £6 internet bundle deal prior to his two-week trip to the States. Mr Baynes said Orange had assured him the bundle would cover roaming charges and enable him to access the internet while abroad. But when he returned home after the trip he found the company had billed him 80 times his usual £50 monthly tariff. Shocked: Robin Bayne on holiday in America. He returned home to a mobile phone bill of more than £4,000 despite being assured by Orange that his £6 bundle would cover him for roaming charges . Extortionate: The £4,182 bill that Orange sent Mr Bayne. The company has offered to reduce the bill to £500, which he has reluctantly agreed to pay . Mr Baynes, from Chester-Le Street, County Durham, thought that the £6 fee would cover his charges for the duration of his trip. He said: 'I was sold this £6 deal under the impression that I . wouldn't be charged extortionate prices for using my phone abroad. 'I specifically phoned Orange and told . them that I wanted to use the internet abroad and they told me that . this \"bundle\" deal, as they call it, would be my best bet. 'When I saw the bill for more than four grand, I was gobsmacked. I am so angry.' Mr Baynes, a coordinator at a private care company, set out to the U.S. on September 24 with his friend Martin Sheridon, 31. They spent four nights in San . Francisco, four nights in LA and six nights in Las Vegas, using the . internet regularly but making only one mobile phone call to the UK. After listening to the recording of his call to the company, Orange has now admitted that he has been falsely sold the deal. The telecoms giant originally offered Mr Baynes £100 towards the bill as a goodwill gesture while insisting he must . pay the remainder of the charges and settle his account. Post-holiday blues: Mr Bayne, left, travelled to the U.S. with friend Martin Sheridan, and visited San Francisco, LA and Las Vegas. He used the internet regularly while abroad but made only one call to the UK . Mr Baynes refused the £100 off offer and Orange increased the reduction in the bill by £1400. After he refused to pay the reduced bill of £2,980.83 Orange finally conceded that he must pay £500, which he reluctantly accepted. He said: 'I feel forced to accept their offer because I have no other choice really. It is absolutely ridiculous. 'The fact that Orange offered me £100 to begin with, and expected me to be grateful, is beyond a joke. 'I shouldn't have to pay out that kind of money when I was led to believe that purchasing a £6 internet bundle deal would cover me against these ridiculous charges.' A spokesman for Orange said: 'We advise customers to call customer services before travelling abroad to find out about the charges and services available. 'In the case of Mr Baynes, we discussed the customer's expected data usage in advance of his travel and provided bundle advice. 'Orange is committed to giving customers transparency when it comes to our roaming rates to ensure they are aware of the different charges when they go abroad. 'We have a number of initiatives in place to help customers control their costs and we hope that these, as well as the customer's own individual responsibility, will ensure customers can manage their roaming costs appropriately. 'We look at all customer complaints on a case-by-case basis and can confirm we have offered Mr Bayne a resolution which he is happy with.'",

    "document": "Prince Charles, who is said to be ready to take over the management of the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk . He is already taking part in a ‘gentle succession’ from his mother, representing the Queen on a growing number of state occasions. Now Prince Charles is stepping into his father’s shoes, too. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the Duke of Edinburgh is privately handing management of Sandringham to his eldest son. The job includes overseeing arable, livestock and fruit farms, property and a 240-acre country park. The 93-year-old Duke is responsible for several estates, including Balmoral, Windsor and Sandringham in Norfolk, where the Royal Family has just enjoyed Christmas. But local sources say Prince Philip started to pass control of Sandringham’s 20,000 acres to Charles this year. The Duke will continue to be consulted over changes, but Charles will have a more hands-on role. ‘We understand Prince Philip has handed the management over to his son,’ said a source. ‘Charles is now taking a very close interest in the estate and its running. He has excellent ideas and we are expecting to see different things happening.’ Estate workers say they expect to see more of the Prince in the coming months as he implements changes, such as more organic farming. Sandringham has been a private home for British monarchs since 1862. As well as the Queen’s country retreat it is a successful commercial estate. Hundreds of fields are leased to commercial farmers. The change has not yet been officially announced and Buckingham Palace last night said it could not comment on what might happen as it is ‘the Queen’s private estate’. But sources close to the Prince of Wales say handing management to Charles would be ‘a natural decision’. Although he is in excellent health, the change will be viewed as further evidence the Duke is scaling back his duties. Philip has cut down overseas travel in recent years but carries out hundreds of engagements for the Queen each year. The Duke began managing Sandringham when he married the Queen. The Sandringham estate, where the Queen and the rest of the royal family spend Christmas, which is famous for producing apples and apple juice . The huge estate includes tidal mudflats, woodland and wetland, and produces everything from wheat to Christmas trees. But it is most famous for its apples and apple juice. The Duke spends most of his time at Windsor or Sandringham. Like his son, he is known for forward thinking, and turned the estates into successful enterprises. At Windsor, he set up a farm shop to generate income. Charles turned his own estate, Highgrove and the Duchy Home Farm, into a model of sustainable farming. He visits Sandringham at Christmas and usually stays there at least once a year. The Duke of Edinburgh, right, is responsible for several estates including Balmoral and Windsor. He is pictured with Timothy Laurence and Princess Anne walking to church in Sandringham on Christmas Day . The change has not yet been officially announced and Buckingham Palace last night said it could not comment on what might happen as it is ‘the Queen’s private estate’ ‘Charles is likely to turn the whole estate organic,’ said the source. ‘He’ll do things like introduce rewards for environmentally friendly farming. Philip’s a passionate conservationist but has very set ways on how the estate should be run. He doesn’t like outsiders interfering.’ Though Sandringham is ‘green’ (5,000 trees are planted each year and all food waste, glass, plastics and paper are recycled) it does not have some of the more modern green techniques Charles uses at Highgrove –such as irrigating the land with rainwater and using bio-dynamic farming methods.",
    "summary": "Prince Charles is set to take control of the management of Sandringham . Currently, Prince Philip is responsible for several of the royal estates .

They were braced for mass protests at Adams Park on Sunday, after announcing a mid-season relocation to Coventry, but there was euphoria rather than anger as Bath were beaten. In the build-up to this Aviva Premiership match, there had been talk of demonstrations following the confirmation that Wasps will be based at the Ricoh Arena from December. Yet, any groundswell of angst was well disguised. There was one banner describing the nomadic club as a ‘franchise’, but even that had vanished by the second-half as Dai Young’s team stormed into a commanding lead. Ultimately, Wasps had to withstand a late Bath rear-guard action as the visitors recovered from 29-0 down to earn a losing bonus point, but there was a collective desperation among the home players to end a turbulent week on a high, which they duly did. Their feat was all the more remarkable as the controversy surrounding their imminent move was not the only disruption.

ATTENDANCE: 7,397. England lock Joe Launchbury was withdrawn from the team on Sunday morning after being involved in a car crash - just as his team-mate, Christian Wade, was last month. Young, the Wasps’ director of rugby, said: ‘There’s never a dull moment here. ‘Joe is fine. Him and his girlfriend were involved in car accident on the way to the game. They were a little bit shaken up. They went to hospital for a check-up and they’re both fine.’ So the last-minute loss of a key forward was a setback for Wasps, but they were glad to avoid the spectre of off-field unrest among their supporters. If anything, the announcement that they are off to the West Midlands seemed to have unexpectedly positive consequences - as they were vociferously backed by their biggest home attendance of the season. Captain James Haskell was evidently delighted by the reception accorded to he and his team-mates, saying: ‘I don’t know about protests - that’s the biggest crowd we’ve had this season. 'Perhaps we should say we’re moving somewhere else next week and we’ll get another big crowd.’ A Wasps fan holds a flag protesting against their move from Adams Park to Coventry's Ricoh Arena . Wasps supporters hold up a banner before the match against Bath at Adams Park on Saturday . Christian Wade (right) chases the ball for the line but is taken out by Micky Young, who was carded . England star Joe Launchbury missed Wasps' victory over Bath after he and his pregnant partner were involved in a car crash. Launchbury tweeted: 'Great win Wasps Rugby today. Gutted to have missed out. Thanks for all your messages of concern. 'Had to go to hospital and check all was ok with my pregnant partner and baby after someone crashed into us. Luckily all is good!' Young added: ‘I totally understood the frustrations of the supporters early in the week, but once we explained everything properly, I saw a real change in their attitude to the move. It was a tough week for them but they got behind the team today and they should be commended and thanked for that.’ If Wasps’ early matches in Coventry are as entertaining as this, they may soon attract decent crowds to the Ricoh Arena. They routed Bath at the scrum as Matt Mullan turned the screw on England’s current first-choice tighthead prop, David Wilson, and from that platform they surged into a 15-0 lead courtesy of four Andy Goode penalties and one long-range shot from Elliot Daly. The visitors were all at sea in the set piece and they were in deeper disarray when three of their players were sent to the sin bin - Leroy Houston, Wilson and Micky Young. The latter man’s off-the-ball tackle on Wade as he chased through a kick by Daly led to a penalty try for Wasps in the 47th minute and left Bath down to 13 men. Moments later, Haskell released the outstanding Ashley Johnson from the back of a lineout on halfway and the flanker's superb off-load sent Sailosi Tagicakibau through a gap and he tore away to score by the posts. Goode converted again and any prospect of protests had been blown away as Wasps seized a 29-0 lead. Kyle Eastmond jumps over the line to score a try for Bath's but they ultimately lost the game at Adams Park . Tempers flare early on in the game as the forwards get into a fight during the match at Adams Park . But Bath have spirit to go with their attacking artistry and they rallied impressively. Kyle Eastmond’s pass picked out Jonathan Joseph on the left and the in-form centre fended off James Gaskell to touch down. Sixteen minutes from time, the deficit was down to 17 points as Young swerved over from close range and George Ford converted. The West Country side kept coming - sensing a way back from a seemingly hopeless position - and after another thunderous drive by Houston, David Sisi scored. Again, Ford added the extras and he followed that up with a 76th-minute penalty, but Wasps held firm to deny their rivals a draw. Young was relieved, saying: ‘That’s pretty much us all over - we either start really poorly and come back, or we end poorly, like we did today. We’re still searching for an 80-minute performance, but for 65 minutes we were outstanding.’ Bath’s head coach, Mike Ford, added: ‘We were just a bit off today - we didn’t have that edge. Our scrum wasn’t as good as it has been for the last two years. They wanted it more than us.’ Bath's Leroy Houston drops Wasps' Joe Simpson past the horizontal and is sin binned as a result .

    "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:19 EST, 4 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 5 July 2013 . A car company looking to gain an edge in the burgeoning ultra-high mileage commuter market hopes to do so by cutting corners. Or, wheels rather. Introducing Elio Motors, a startup vehicle manufacturer based in Michigan that hopes to get Americans plying the streets minus one wheel in skinny little cars that feature two in the front and just one in the back. Scroll down for video... Somethings missing: Meet the Elio, a three-wheeled car, the makers of which hope will change the way America commutes . And to do so, founder Paul Elio demanded his vehicle live up to four basic principles, reports MLive. First, the three wheeled car had to get at least 84 miles to the gallon on the highway. Second, it could cost no more than $6,800. It had to also receive a 5-star safety rating in spite of its size. Finally, Elio’s car had to be American made. Svelte: The 850-pound, two-seater car gets 84mph and costs less than $7,000, giving buys plenty of reasons not to miss a back tire . So far, the three-wheeled car has met those marks. Weighing in at 850 pounds, the Elio’s svelteness allows it to glide without the need for an SUV-sized fuel tank. And with five airbags, there’s little room in the skinny car to hit anything hard once they’ve deployed. Unfortunately, the car has lived up to its founder’s specifications only in the form of a few prototypes. Inspiration? The Elio mixes the compact size of the Smart car with the stability and maneuverability of the Can-Am Spyder cycle (left) The Elio has yet to undergo federal crash test rating. That along with some other red tape means the prototypes—which have so far emerged painted shades of silver, black, white, blue, orange (called creasicle), red and bright green—aren’t street legal. But Elio’s representatives have been happy to take industry insiders out for a spin. Soon to come: The car is slated to start being made in Louisiana next summer and interested buyers can put down deposits now. The higher the deposit, the quicker they'll get their Elio . And Elio’s vice president of marketing Chip Stempeck will soon be touring Michigan cities in an Elio. According to Stempeck, interested buyers can put down deposits in varying increments, sort of like a Kickstarter campaign. The larger the deposit, the sooner the buyer will get his or her Elio once production begins. Elio says that will be sometime next summer, when the company will start assembling its three-wheel cars in an old General Motors plant Louisiana. Colorful: This far, makers plan for the Elio to come in blue, black, red, green, silver, and creamsicle (pictured)",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Is a star player more important than team unity? England's cricketers will find out the answer to that question over the next five days as they battle to retain the No. 1 Test ranking without key batsman Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen, one of the most flamboyant and controversial players in the game, has been dropped for the showdown with South Africa -- the country of his birth -- after falling out with his teammates. England's preparations for the third and final Test of the series, which they must win to stop the Proteas taking top spot, have been dominated by a scandal over derogatory text messages, an ill-advised YouTube video and a parody Twitter account. All of which involved Pietersen in some form. The 32-year-old issued an apology on Wednesday for sending text messages to the South African players during the drawn second Test which apparently criticized England captain Andrew Strauss -- who celebrates his 100th appearance in the five-day game at Lord's this week. But it was too late to stop him being thrown out of the squad and now seemingly unlikely to be named on Saturday in England's team for the Twenty 20 World Cup in Sri Lanka starting next month. \"I did send what you might call provocative texts to my close friends in the SA team,\" said Pietersen. \"The texts were meant as banter between close friends. I need to rein myself in sometimes. I apologize to Straussy and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts. I truly didn't mean to cause upset or tension particularly with important games at stake.\" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), however, has refused to say whether Pietersen will ever play for England again. \"We are in receipt of Kevin's apology, but further discussions need to take place to establish whether it is possible to regain the trust and mutual respect required to ensure all parties are able to focus on playing cricket and to maintain the unity of purpose that has served us so well in recent years,\" said ECB managing director Hugh Morris. \"Critically, those discussions should take place behind closed doors, rather than in the media spotlight. \"A successful conclusion to this process is in everyone's best interests and is required for Kevin Pietersen's potential selection in all forms of the game to be considered.\" The South Africa series presents England's biggest challenge since regaining the number one ranking last year. Strauss' side lost the first Test and drew the second, with Pietersen scoring a defiant 149 before making an unexpected statement at the press conference casting doubt over his international future. \"It's tough for me in this dressing room,\" he said . Rumors of \"provocative\" text messages sent to some of the South African players increased the pressure on Pietersen. The South African camp, however, dismissed the texts and claimed that the ECB hadn't even asked them to see the messages before they dropped Pietersen. \"Text messages were sent, but it was banter,\" said team manager Mohammed Moosajee. \"The ECB has not made a formal approach to see the text messages as is currently being reported in the media.\" Pietersen has always been a controversial figure, with England's management tolerating him due to his undeniable talent. He is one of a handful of England players to play in the lucrative Indian Premier League -- where he plays alongside several of the South African players -- and earlier this year retired from the national team's one-day and Twenty 20 teams, apparently so he could play more limited-overs cricket in India and Australia. In a remarkable turn of events on Saturday, Pietersen released a YouTube video in which he reversed his retirement, committed himself to English cricket and attempted to explain some of the recent controversy. Crucially, he failed to apologize for the text messages. \"I've had a change of heart because I love playing cricket for England, I love being part of a successful England team,\" said Pietersen. \"It would be sad for me to finish with the way things have been running through the media in the last three or four days -- it would be sad to end my career like this. \"So sitting down with my family, my advisers, my close friends, we've decided and I've decided it would be a lot better to finish my career on a positive note rather than one that's being developed at the moment.\" The video didn't go far enough for the ECB, who instead called up promising youngster Jonny Bairstow. Pietersen is a regular on microblogging site Twitter, but was said to be furious when a parody account was set up -- called \"KP Genius\" -- and it was followed by several senior England players. The were suggestions that one of Pietersen's colleagues was responsible for the account, which had joked that Pietersen was motivated solely by money and thought he was better than the rest of the England squad. Eventually, a man called Richard Bailey, who describes himself as \"an England cricket fan,\"admitted he set up the account. To further complicate matters Stuart Broad, captain of England's Twenty 20 side, is friends with Bailey. The ECB was forced to put out a statement on Broad's behalf on Tuesday, less than 36 hours before the crucial Test got under way, denying any involvement with the account. \"Following the statement by Mr. Richard Bailey that he was responsible for creating a parody Twitter account in Kevin Pietersen's name, I would like to confirm that I had no involvement in this whatsoever,\" said Broad. \"I met with the managing director of England cricket, Hugh Morris, and assured him that I did not play any role in the creation of this account or provide Mr. Bailey with any information regarding Kevin Pietersen or the England team. \"As has been widely reported Mr. Bailey is a friend of mine, but we had no conversations regarding this issue at all and I am pleased that he has now decided to close the parody account down.\" South Africa captain Graeme Smith described the situation as \"amazing,\" and claimed that in the visitors' dressing room the matter has \"hardly been discussed.\" \"From our perspective it's just been so overboard really. I can't believe it's still carrying on,\" he said. Smith, who is due to captain his country for a record-breaking 94th time at Lord's, described Pietersen as \"world class, and warned England that it would be \"wrong\" to say \"they're not going to miss him.\"",

    "document": "THE FISH LADDER . by Katharine Norbury . (Bloomsbury £16.99) When Katharine Norbury was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer in her mid-40s, she told the radiographer: ‘I have a ten‑year-old daughter. I have to live.’ Katharine Norbury tells of her emotional journey to reconnect with her family (picture posed by model) The doctor asked if there was a history of breast cancer in her family, but Norbury didn’t know. She was adopted. Attempts to trace her biological mother had failed and her father was merely a dash on a birth certificate. Though she was raised by wonderful adoptive parents, she had always felt ‘dizzyingly adrift’. This uncertainty about her own origins drives her to seek out more tangible sources: those of rivers around the British Isles. In this crisp, poetic little book, Norbury describes her walks beside rivers, including the Thames, Mersey and Severn. She first began these walks to ward off the depression she felt looming after a late miscarriage, not many months before the cancer diagnosis. She had suffered from mental illness before. While working as a successful TV script editor, she had awoken from an unexplained blackout to find herself coughing blood down a sink, while her husband (novelist Rupert Thomson) sobbed in the shower beside her, with his head in his hands. She had a feeling she had been screaming, but no memory of what or why. Another time she made herself a cup of tea and walked to her bedroom window. As she pulled the curtains, she found five other cups lined up along the sill, each in various stages of cooling. Norbury knew she could not go back into that dark place. She had to stay sane and strong for daughter Evie, who had longed for a brother. So she began to walk. Evie keeps her mother company on some of these adventures, but Norbury’s most extraordinary journeys are taken alone. A scary man is spotted hurling rocks into the sea. She is too afraid of him to pass, and so makes the bizarre decision to curl up and sleep in the sand dunes until he has gone. When she awakes, he is there and she retreats to her car, only to find somebody has let her tyres down. Although her birth mother has made no effort to contact her, Norbury finds her living near the source of the River Severn. She walks past this woman’s house and fantasises about a reunion of flowers and chocolates. She imagines receiving a letter confessing: ‘I love you. There has not been one day when I have not thought of you.’ Instead she receives a cold rebuff: a nasty note explaining she was the result of a ‘quickie’ at a party in Australia and had been delivered under general anaesthetic so that her mother never even saw her and wants to hear no more about the ‘horrible’ matter. The rejection makes it easier for Norbury to ignore her wishes and she traces her half (or possibly full) brothers, Robert and Ioan, in Wales. Online she finds a rugby team photograph and in it a ‘smiling man, who had my daughter’s eyes’. They go along to a match and Norbury realises how much an uncle might mean to little Evie. A few days after the match, Evie is holding a bundle: ‘Soft and fluffy, and smelling of milk and fabric softener.’ Her baby cousin. As mother and daughter drive home, they pass the village where Norbury’s birth mother lives. They don’t stop. Coming out of the slick, wet darkness of a storm, they count seven rainbows in the sky ahead.",

Three generations of the same family killed in an arson attack had a triple funeral service today - with the teenage mother and her young baby in the same coffin. Kayleigh Buckley, 17, and her daughter Kimberley, six months, died in the blaze along with the baby’s grandmother Kim Buckley, 46. More than 800 people attended the funeral of the three generations of the same family in Cwmbran, South Wales. Hundreds of mourners attended the service at St Gabriel's Church in Cwmbran, where the coffin of Kayleigh Buckley was brought in (pictured) The funeral took place for Kim, Kayleigh and Kimberley Buckley, who all died in a house fire in Cwmbran, south Wales . The coffin of Kim Buckley is carried by mourners, who are all devastated that the grandmother was killed hours after welcoming her granddaughter home . Relatives said it was fitting that Kayleigh and Kimblerley were laid in the same coffin covered in cream flowers for the service. The new mum had just celebrated Kimberley’s homecoming from hospital after being born three months prematurely at just 1lb 9ozs when fire ripped through their home. The tiny baby had been brought home just six hours before the blaze began. Kayleigh visited her surviving baby every day in hospital for five months until the child was allowed out for the first time. In a Facebook message last week Kayleigh said: 'She is 11lbs 3oz. Getting excited now. Could be home soon but not saying until she is home. Don’t want to jinx it.' Congratulations banners were hung from the family home and there was a little party for family and friends on Monday night when they finally brought Kayleigh home. The house was set on fire around 3am the next morning as the family slept. People nearby heard Kayleigh screaming: ‘Help, us, help us’ as the fire ripped through the family home. Firefighters found their bodies shortly afterwards. The funeral was attended by firefighters who battled to save the family when the flames tore through their home last month. Pictured here is Kayleigh Buckley & baby Kimberley Buckley, who both died in the blaze that swept through their home . Many of the mourners wore red in honour of football fan Kim¿s love of Liverpool . Blaze: Fire damage can be seen on the roof of the semi-detached home as well as smoke marks on the wall . Police investigating the deaths were also at the service at St Gabriel’s Church in Cwmbran. Afterwards the cremation took place at Gwent Crematorium. Many of the mourners wore red in honour of soccer fan Kim’s love of Liverpool. Father Michael Phillips, Rector of Cwmbran, told the mourners: 'We simply cannot believe what has happened - it was all so sudden. 'Our hearts are filled with justifiable anger and with questions as to why. The Right Reverend Dominic Walker, Bishop of Monmouth, added: 'Kayleigh was a shy, but loving girl, who together with her mum was overjoyed to become a mum herself. 'Her baby Kimberly fought bravely for many months until strong enough to come home to a house filled with balloons. 'Within hours it all, through the fire, ended in tragedy.' The service sung a number of hymns including Abide With Me, Love Divine, Guide me O Thou Great Redeemer, All Things Bright and Beautiful. The family asked for donations to be sent to the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Gwent Hospital were Kayleigh gave birth to little Kimberley. Kayleigh’s ex-boyfriend Carl Mills, 28, has been charged with their murder and will appear in court in December. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

The jibes saw charity bosses write to Gervais to demand he stop using the word, which they saw is a cruel nickname for Down's Syndrome sufferers. Ofcom launched an investigation, but today cleared Channel 4 of breaching guidelines on offensive content. The TV regulator ruled that although Gervais's comments could cause 'considerable offence', they were justified in the context of a late night comedy show. Ofcom ruled that Gervais's jibes towards Susan Boyle were 'justified in the context of provocative comedy' During the show, Gervais went on to say that he didn't mean Boyle had Down's Syndrome, and argued the word 'mong' was no longer associated with sufferers of the condition. Ofcom said that in the name of freedom of expression, no word was banned after the TV watershed. However, there must be a good reason for using language many people find offensive. The regulator's own research found that many people did not know of ‘mong’ came from the term ‘mongoloid’ – an offensive term for people with Down‟s syndrome – but it ‘could cause considerable offence to those who are aware of the association’. In its ruling, Ofcom said: 'We noted that the programme began at 22:35, more than an hour and a half after the watershed, and that therefore most viewers of the programme would have been expecting stronger and more challenging content. 'The late scheduling of the programme, . and its late night comedy context on Channel 4, meant that the majority . of the audience was likely to expect the exploratory and subversive . bent of the programme in general and of Ricky Gervais's humour in . particular. 'Offensive': Gervais's previous use of the word 'mong' saw him contacted by campaigners who demand he stop using the term . The comedian has insisted the meaning of the word 'mong' has changed over time . 'We also took . into account that Channel 4 brought the challenging nature of the . content to the attention of viewers with a warning at the start of the . programme, which stated that it would contain 'strong language and adult . humour'. 'We therefore concluded that several aspects of this content had the potential to cause considerable offence. 'However, on balance, this potential offence was justified by the context of this provocative comedy routine challenging the evolution of words, as broadcast with a warning as part of a late night comedy show on Channel 4.' The broadcasting regulator did, however, issue a warning to TV bosses about the use of the word 'mong'. Although Gervais claims 'mong' is no longer a derogatory term, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) still classifies it as offensive: . Its entry states:'Mongol: A person with Down's syndrome. Now generally regarded as offensive.' The use of the word harks back to the implied similarity in appearance of those with Down's syndrome and the Mongol race of East Asia - who established an empire in much of Eurasia during the 13th century. Its un-PC usage is cited in the OED as far back as 1866: . 'I have for some time had my attention directed to the possibility of making a classification of the feeble-minded by arranging them around various ethnic standards. 'A very large number of congenital idiots are typical Mongols.' The citation is from none other than John Langdon Down - the man after whom Down's syndrome was named. It was Down's work at an asylum in Surrey in the late 1860s that led to the term 'Mongolian idiocy' being used to classify certain clinical cases. It was not until 1961 that the term Down's syndrome was first used, following consultation with genetics experts unhappy with the previous label. They said their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and 'great care' should be taken over its use. Gervais has been criticised by the Down Syndrome's Association for his repeated use of the word. The award-winning comedian and writer landed himself in hot water for a second time with his use of the word by repeatedly using the word 'mong' on his Twitter account and blog. After using the word on the mico-blogging site, Gervais was eventually questioned by Nicola Clark, a disability campaigner and mother of two disabled girls. Mrs Clark broke down in tears while discussing the row on Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show last October. Mrs Clark had wept while discussing the abuse directed at her daughters by people on the street using words like ‘mong’. Multi-millionaire Gervais went on to describe his use of 'mong' as 'naive' in an online conversation with Mrs Clark. Gervais then contacted Mrs Clark on Twitter to offer ‘a very public thank you’ for her ‘kind, rational and understanding words in private’ since the issue broke. Speaking about the controversy last year, Gervais said: 'I have used 'mong', but never to mean Down Syndrome and never would. 'The meaning of words change over time, 'gay' for example. 'The modern use of the word 'mong' means dopey or ignorant, it's in slang and urban dictionaries.' Channel 4 argued that Gervais was 'exploring the contemporary use of the word in a comedic context' and said he did not mean to suggest Boyle had a disability. After Gervais's use of the word 'mong' in October, Penny Green, director of Down's Syndrome charity Down's Heart Group, refuting his claim that the meaning of the word has changed. After learning of Ofcom's ruling, she told MailOnline today: It's very sad that in effect Ofcom is excusing Ricky Gervais because of the time the show was broadcast and a very loose warning about content and yet they issued a warning to TV bosses about the use of the word saying 'their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and 'great care' should be taken over its use.' 'It's almost like giving carte blanche to anyone to use offensive language directed at a particular group just as long as they do it at 'an appropriate time'. 'Why can't we just accept people for who they are? And if we really can't cope with their differences (usually from fear of the unknown or outdated and unrealistic stories I might add), can't we just avoid them without feeling the need to publicly poke fun at and humiliate them.' A spokeswoman for Boyle refused to comment. Representatives for Ricky Gervais did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "document": "A heartbroken mother has been ordered to get a DNA test carried out on her dead partner - so his name can be put on their baby daughter's birth certificate. Sarah Dixon, from Little Hulton, Salford, lost her partner David Broome in a car smash last month, just weeks after their baby Shenayah was born. But, because the couple were not married, she has been told that his name cannot be added to their nine-week-old baby's birth certificate unless she pays for a DNA test to prove that he was the father. David Broome (pictured with his newborn daughter Shenayah) was fatally injured in a car accident in north Wales in October before he was able to sign his baby's birth certificate . The couple had planned to register the birth together just days before David's tragic death . The law states that unmarried parents need to sign the birth register together or get a court order proving you a parent. Sarah will now have to pay in the region of £4,000 to take the fight to court and to pay for DNA to be analysed by a court appointed testing service. Sarah, 25, said: 'We planned to register her together on the Monday and he died on the Wednesday before. I went to Salford register office and they said 'we need the father here to register the birth.' It broke my heart. They told me they couldn't register the birth because we were not married.' A happy family: David Broome with Sarah Dixon and Shenayah before the tragic car crash . Sarah will now have to pay in the region of £4,000 to take the fight to court and to pay for DNA to be analysed by a court appointed testing service . David's family have asked for toenail clippings and tissue samples to be taken from the coroner in north Wales, where the accident happened, as evidence that 26-year-old David was the father. A petition signed by more than 1,500 people and a Facebook page Give Shenayah Broome Her Father's Name On Her Birth Certificate has now been launched. Sarah added: 'We were together for three years so it was like we were married. 'He was at the birth, he went to all the scans and we were together for three years. He even cut the cord following the birth. Sarah, 25, said it 'broke her heart' when she was told by Salford registery office that they would need the father present to register the birth . The loving father, from Salford, also leaves two sons Cayden, six, and Harley, five . 'I feel that this is punishing our baby.' David died following the crash which also left his 18-year-old nephew Norman Gregory with leg and chest injuries. The postman and DJ, from Irlams o' th' Height, Salford, also leaves two sons Cayden, six, and Harley, five. David, a former pupil at Buile Hill Visual Arts College, was a passenger in a Ford Ka driven by his nephew when it was in collision with a Skoda Octavia on the Nant Y Garth pass near Felinheli, in Gwynedd. His funeral was held at St Thomas' Church, Pendleton and Agecroft Cemetery last Monday. Sarah was told she needs a DNA test to register her deceased partner David on their daughter's birth certificate as they were unmarried . All births in England must be registered at the local registry office or hospital within 42 days of the child being born. Within married couples, just one parent is able to register the birth and include both mother's and father's details. But for unmarried couples, the law demands that mothers must provide proof of parentage unless both parents are present. This can be in the form of a signed declaration of parentage form, or a court document, such as an order giving the father parental responsibility, or court ordered DNA test. If these cannot be provided, the father's details won't be included on the birth certificate. It can be possible to add the father's details at a later date by completing an application for the re-registration of a child's birth. Where neither parents are able register the birth, a member of the administrative staff at the hospital where the child was born or someone present at the birth, are allowed to register on their behalf.",

Attending a players 'dinner at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships Murray looked unimpressed as the pretty woman pranced around him. Although he did turn to look at her at one point there was not even a flicker of a grin on his face. While the belly dancer tried her best to impress tennis champ Andy Murray he didn't look that happy to be attending the player's party following his first match at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships . Andy looked bored as he attended the dinner last night in Dubai . He appeared to be there on his own, as Kim, who's usually loyally at his side, was nowhere in sight. Andy is currently in Dubai to take part in the championships and yesterday he won his first round against Luxembourg's Giles Muller. Yesterday he said of his win: 'I made him work very hard on his service games. That was something I wanted to try to do from early on. 'The end of both sets I didn't serve so well but apart from that, I didn't give him any opportunities really.' It is yet to be seen what Murray's finance Kim Sears will make of the scantily clad woman dancing around her man. The 27-year-old is known for her fiery temper after she was caught swearing on camera in January. The belly dancer was seen trying to talk to the tennis champion during the meal held for players . Andy sat drinking a glass of water during the evening, his fiancee Kim Sears did not attend the event with him . Andy won his first match yesterday against Gilles Muller of Luxembourg . As Andy took on Czech player Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open semi final she was seen calling him a, 'Czech Flash F***.' However, she poked fun at herself the next day when she rocked up to Andy's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content.' But her fans were still not impressed with some of them accusing Kim, who is an artist who specialises in pet portraits, of racism. Andy later defending her actions saying in an interview that she had been 'whipped up,' by the media storm surrounding his match. The day after being caught on camera swearing during one of Andy's tennis matches Kim was spotted wearing this parental advisory jumper . Andy and Kim are set to marry in a couple of months time at the hotel he owns in Scotland . He said: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.' He added: 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' Kim and Andy got engaged in November 2014 after nine years together. He presented her with a £200,000 which he is thought to have chosen himself. It was recently confirmed that the pair have set the date for their wedding as the 11th of April. They will wed in an intimate ceremony at Cromlix House, a hotel in Scotland owned by Murray himself.",

    "document": "Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- Honduras, the country with the world's highest murder rate, is backing talks between its two most violent gangs in search of a truce. The Mara Salvatrucha and Calle 18 gangs gave separate statements from a prison in San Pedro Sula on Tuesday, asking forgiveness from the public for the violence and declaring a cease-fire. Gang members spoke with their faces covered with bandanas to disguise their identities as they pushed for peace. \"We are going to start now. ... We have now spent more than a decade being always involved in crime and mistreatment, which has also affected us, and what we want is peace,\" a representative of the Calle 18 gang told reporters. But a deal between the long-warring gangs isn't yet on the table. \"We cannot have a truce with other people who do not think like we do,\" a representative of the Mara Salvatrucha said from the prison inside a city that has been described as the world's murder capital. \"We are going to respect their territory, but let them also respect our territory, so that the violence decreases,\" a Calle 18 representative said. The gangs already reached a truce in neighboring El Salvador, and officials there claim the murder rate has dropped dramatically. Honduran leaders hope for the same. Gang members who spoke from the prison on Tuesday said they wanted the government to help them find work. \"They want to reconcile with Honduran society and ask for forgiveness from the Honduran people, and I think it is a step forward,\" said San Pedro Sula Bishop Romulo Emiliani, who first revealed the talks a week ago. \"What is coming is difficult. It is not easy. It is complicated.\" But despite the difficulties of negotiations, Emiliani told the Honduran newspaper La Prensa that down the line, \"depending on certain factors, there may be a truce between the two gangs.\" On Monday, Honduran President Porfirio Lobo gave the government's backing. Lobo said he called Emiliani to \"express my congratulations and my appreciation in name of the people of Honduras.\" The Organization of American States, through Secretary for Multidimensional Security Adam Blackwell, is also participating in the process. \"We have talked to my knowledge for the past eight months, trying to find the same type of reaction as we have in El Salvador,\" Blackwell said Tuesday. According to the United Nations, in 2011, Honduras had the highest murder rate in the world, at 91.6 killings per 100,000 people. That same year, El Salvador registered the second-highest murder rate, at 69.2 killings per 100,000. These most recent statistics from the United Nations do not reflect the impact of the gang truce in El Salvador, but officials there say it is significant. According the Salvadoran government, the number of murders has fallen by 52% since the truce was signed 14 months ago. The average number of killings fell from 13 per day to 6 per day. According to a U.S. State Department travel warning, however, the truce has had little impact on robbery, assaults and other violent crime.

Hospital managers behind one of the worst health scandals in living memory won glowing praise from the head of the NHS. At the height of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, Sir David Nicholson toured wards and in a follow-up letter said ‘well done’ for ‘progress in target areas’. The visit came in October 2005 – a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200. At the height of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, Sir David Nicholson toured wards and in a follow-up letter said 'well done' for 'progress in target areas' Bereaved families, who are calling for Sir David to quit, say many lives could have been spared had he investigated the health trust. In other developments in the NHS crisis: . The letter obtained by the Mail shows the NHS chief visited Mid Staffordshire’s two hospitals – Stafford and Cannock Chase – while he was in charge of the regional health board. It is thought the visit was on October 27 and was followed by a letter of congratulation to the chief executive. It noted improvements on hitting targets for waiting times in casualty, cancer treatment, surgery and outpatients. Yet that month an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke was sent home by a casualty doctor who misdiagnosed her as having a urine infection. The visit came in October 2005 ¿ a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200 . She fell into a coma two days later and died. Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother died at the trust, said: ‘He should have been asking questions of the trust’s chief executive, not congratulating him. ‘The care was just disastrous from 2004 and it became a longstanding problem. He is ultimately responsible. How can he carry on in his job after all this?’ Last week Sir David was implicated in another scandal when it emerged he had ignored warnings about a hospital trust where 670 patients may have died needlessly. Gary Walker and David Bowles, the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored. Mr Walker was later sacked and given a £500,000 pay-off with a gagging clause to keep silent. The trust is being investigated by the NHS for having one of the highest death rates in the country. Yesterday, the Prime Minister added to the pressure by saying the NHS needed to act on problems ‘much more swiftly’. Mr Cameron said there had been ‘no accountability’ for the failings at Mid Staffordshire with those responsible being allowed to quietly retire or move on. Speaking from Mumbai, he added: ‘There wasn’t proper accountability. There weren’t proper consequences and that is not acceptable.’ Last week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote to all health trusts urging them not to use gagging orders to deter whistleblowing. Asked about this, the Prime Minister said: ‘I agree with what Jeremy Hunt has said over the last couple of days. You shouldn’t need to rely on whistleblowing in the NHS, we should be discovering problems much more swiftly. We should be discovering them as they occur.’ Gary Walker (left) and David Bowles (right), the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored . Mr Cameron said the Government was trying to get hospital trusts to provide better care by asking patients whether they would recommend them to their friends and family. But he made clear where this fails, there is a case for whistleblowing: ‘That’s what the transparency agenda is about. That’s what the friends and family test is about, that’s what boosting the Care Quality Commission is all about. That’s what the chief inspector of hospitals is all about. Sir David has been facing increasing calls to resign since a report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal was published earlier this month. Sir David also appointed the trust’s failed chief executive Martin Yeates – even though he had no formal managerial training and went on to sack 50 nurses. Later, as chief executive of the Department of Health, he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives. He apparently told a watchdog investigating the hospital trust not to pay too much attention to the concerns of the families as they were ‘simply lobbying’. Up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire and many hundreds of others suffered ‘inhumane’ and ‘inexcusable’ care. Sir David, who earns £211,000 a year, has resisted calls to resign, saying the failures have been ‘system wide’. But last week two Tory MPs from the health select committee, Chris Skidmore and Sarah Wollaston, urged him to consider his position. An online petition on a Government website calling on him to go has received 3,796 signatures. A spokesman for Sir David Nicholson said: ‘Sir David took on responsibility for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Health Authority for just ten months, along with being chief executive of two other health authorities. ‘There was no information that he saw during that time that alerted him to the problems at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.’",

    "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . A North Carolina Republican candidate campaigning against same-sex marriage has been outed as a former drag queen performer known as 'Miss Mona Sinclair'. Steve Wiles, a conservative state Senate candidate, donned a wig and fake lashes for eight years at the now defunct gay-friendly lounge Club Odyssey, where he directed and emceed a weekly drag show. The club's former owner Randy Duggins told Winston-Salem Journal he broke his silence because he wants voters to know that Wiles is, he believes, a 'hypocrite' and 'liar'. Wiles, 34, initially denied the bombshell allegations, but came out yesterday admitting his past. 'For me, from a religious standpoint, just for my life, for me, it just was not something that I wanted to continue,' the fledgling politician told Business Insider about being a drag queen. 'Of course it was an embarrassment, but you know, you move on. You live life, and you change, and you make yourself what you want yourself to be. And that's where I am now.' Revelation: Outspoken gay marriage opponent Steve Wiles, 34 (pictured) has been outed as having worked as a drag queen performer known as 'Miss Mona Sinclair' Wiles, who doesn't consider himself 'anti-gay', supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in North Carolina.

Americans, regardless of their sexuality, and believes 'state control of . the institution of marriage is unconstitutional'. Wiles, who refuses to comment on his own sexuality, said that he doesn't believe being against same-sex marriage is the same thing as being anti-gay. 'I don't really understand how you can separate the fact that marriage is a religious institution,' Wiles told Business Insider.

According to the Journal, Wiles was also listed on the 'Miss Gay America' site as a 'former promoter of Miss Gay Eastern States America and a city preliminary promoter for Miss Gay North Carolina America'. The webpage also said that Wiles was suspended for 'conduct unbecoming to a promoter of the Miss Gay America pageant system'. Wiles maintains that the role was 'just something I didn't want to continue'. While he now views his past as a drag queen as 'an embarrassment' and at odds with his Christian beliefs, he said there were positive things he took away from the experience.

'I'm sure many of you saw my glowing recommendation in the Winston Salem Journal - I'd like to apologize to everyone because, unlike the currently appointed NC Senator in District 31, I made mistakes,' he allegedly wrote. 'My job was embarrassing - I had to have a job! Nobody died, leaving me a millionaire capable of living in North Carolina's most expensive neighborhood. One thing I will say, I learned from my mistakes... 'I understand the gay community does not share my support for the Marriage Amendment - I RESPECT THAT and am very happy to discuss my views with any of my friends in the Democrat party and gay community.

    "document": "They might have been waiting for Michele Bachelet, the well-respected President of Chile, but Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia only had eyes for each other. As they stood on the red carpet outside the El Pardo Palace awaiting Ms Bachelet, the couple, who married in 2004, exchanged loving glances - and continued to do so long after the South American premier had made her entrance. Later, the pair stood side by side as they took a salute from the guard of honour laid on for Ms Bachelet who was making her first visit to Spain since being elected president in March. Scroll down for video . The look of love: King Felipe and Queen Letizia exchange glances as they wait for President Bachelet . Romance: The couple, who married in 2004 and have two daughters, are clearly still very much in love . The encounter with the Spanish couple is not, however, her first brush with a royal since taking the helm in Chile. In June, Ms Bachelet, a socialist, was left beaming after Prince Harry made a state visit to the country and met with her at the Palacio de La Moneda in Santiago. This time around, the president, who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist, was left smiling after a chat with King Felipe, 46, during which Letizia, 42, looked on. Letizia herself is fresh from a successful trip to Austria where she made a speech at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Looking good: Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon in her grey suit and pearl earrings . Big moment: The royal couple look on as they take a salute from the guard of honour laid on for Ms Bachelet . Pomp: The welcome ceremony at the El Pardo Palace saw ranks of soldiers dressed in their best file past . Big arrival: Ms Bachelet was making her first visit to Spain since being elected earlier this year . First visit: Prince Harry, pictured here in Santiago, was the first royal to shake the hand of the Chilean president . Delighted: Ms Bachelet appeared almost as delighted to meet King Felipe as she was to meet Prince Harry . All smiles: President Bachelet waves to photographers as she's escorted into the El Pardo by Queen Letizia . The speech, which was made partly in German and in English, was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the Spanish artist, Diego Velázquez. Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood. On their way: President Bachelet appeared to be enjoying her visit to Spain - her first since taking office . Dramatic: The smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony . Esteem: Unusually, the ceremony was held at the grand El Pardo Palace instead of the Zarzuela . All smiles: After bowing his head for the National Anthem, Felipe beamed broadly at the soldiers on parade . Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita. Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary. Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague alongside King Felipe, among her most recent trips. Stylish: As is her wont, Queen Letizia cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the El Pardo's steps . Nice to meet you: Queen Letizia was greeted by Austrian president Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit in Vienna . Launch: She was in the Austrian capital for the launch of an exhibition dedicated to artist, Diego Velázquez . Striking: Diego Velázquez' most famous painting is Las Meninas, which was created for King Felipe VI .",

    "document": "(CNN) -- As beer bottles flew and bonfires burned at the annual Pumpkin Fest in Keene, New Hampshire, over the weekend, those following the events online compared the \"riotous behavior\" near Keene State College to protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Their common refrain: a racist double standard in law enforcement response and media coverage that they attempted to mock using hashtags #PumpkinSpiceRiots and #Pumpkinfest, among others. 'Apples to oranges' Such comparisons are complicated, experts say, because Keene and Ferguson arose from different circumstances. Yes, law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets at both scenes, but otherwise, the two events are an \"apples to oranges comparison,\" said Donna Murch, associate professor of history at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Based on what we know about Keene, the mostly white riots appear to have stemmed from alcohol-fueled parties. Ferguson is an ongoing, organized movement prompted by the shooting death of an unarmed black teen, said Murch, whose research focuses around civil rights, social movements and policing. \"It demeans Ferguson and St. Louis to compare them to Pumpkin Fest,\" said Murch, who has spent time with protesters in Missouri. \"While the use of tear gas reflects how normative these militarized population control measures have become, Ferguson is a political movement, and looting (in Keene) is quite different from the civil disobedience we're seeing in Ferguson.\" Sentiments about the militarization of law enforcement echoed throughout social media over the weekend, but they were largely overshadowed by racial discourse. That's where the conversation took a productive turn, Murch said: by shifting the discussion from comparisons between Ferguson and Keene to differences in how society perceives black and white behavior. \"That kind of comparison is really important because it's those attitudes that make state violence possible,\" Murch said. \"White youth are allowed to be children and have a sense of protection no matter how they behave, while black youth are criminalized by justice system. They're not allowed to have childhoods.\" Perceptions of behavior . Those perceptions extend to riots, too, which most people tend to associate with the black community, said Victoria W. Wolcott, director of undergraduate studies at the University of Buffalo-New York and author of \"Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America.\" \"Race riots\" tends to conjure memories of the Rodney King acquittal or 1967 Detroit, but those are anomalies, Wolcott said. Throughout history, white mobs have perpetrated the majority of racially motivated riots against the black community over integration in public and private life -- from the 1863 draft riots to the civil rights battles of the 1960s. \"It speaks to the notion that white violent behavior is not something talked about or stigmatized in the media or in mainstream society to extent that African-American rioting or looting behavior is,\" Wolcott said. Pumpkin Fest was a dramatic version of that because of initial characterizations of crowd behavior as rowdy: vandalization of cars and streets signs, fighting police and setting fires in the streets. White people frequently get \"rowdy\" at sporting events or music festivals, but that behavior is not associated with the white community on the whole in the same way that instances of looting or vandalization tend to be associated with the black community, she said. \"White behavior gets normalized,\" she said. \"In the African-American community, the long-term complaint is that the behavior of a small number of people stigmatizes the entire race or community. But you don't hear that same racialized language about small groups of white people that behave badly. They do not stigmatize the community in the same way.\" Picking battles . Journalism professor Douglas M. McLeod of the University of Wisconsin-Madison agrees that comparing the nature of the two events is \"preposterous,\" seeing as Ferguson arose from \"enduring, longstanding\" issues related to race and inequality that keep the protests alive, unlike in Keene. But as far as media coverage goes, he sees the two as having more in common than others might believe. Both instances were framed as narratives in which the media strove to maintain neutrality by depicting facts on the ground -- what happened, who was there, how many arrests -- essentially, a story pitting police against the crowd instead of going deep into the themes and issues. \"When we do that, the underlying message is, here's a group that was creating chaos or disrupting order, and the response of police was to restore order,\" said McLeod, whose research focuses on the impact of media coverage in social conflicts. \"If there is justification for being upset about the coverage, it's the fact that the Ferguson situation was treated so much like the New Hampshire, not that they were treated differently. They were treated like they didn't have enduring issues or evidence to support their frustrations and claims.\" He understands the history of discrimination and inequality that gives rise to frustrations when incidents like this occur. But \"If I were them, I'd pick their battles to focus on the bad coverage in Ferguson,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things to be concerned about in racial inequity and discrimination. This may not be the best example case to hold up.\"",
    "summary": "Experts say what happened in Keene was a riot; Ferguson is a political movement . And yet Pumpkin Fest violence prompted important debate about racial perceptions ."

    "document": "(CNN) -- Most of the great land expeditions in the world have already been conquered. But British explorers Ben Saunders and Tarka L'Herpiniere are about to set off on one of the last. The two-man team is heading to Antarctica to attempt to walk the 2,987 kilometer (1,800 mile) journey to the South Pole and back. If they succeed, it will be the longest unsupported polar journey in history. They will be re-tracing the steps of Captain Robert Falcon Scott who had hoped to be become the first man to reach the South Pole. It was only when the ill-fated British explorer arrived at the Pole in January 1912 that he found someone else had beaten him to it. His rival Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had claimed the honor 33 days earlier. Read more: Landmark exhibition celebrates century since Scott's fateful journey . \"I can't imagine what their morale must have been turning around at the Pole, having found a Norwegian flag there, and having to walk all the way back to the coast,\" says Saunders. Scott himself gives some insight to his feelings in the journal found with his body when it was discovered in November 2012 just 17.7km (11 miles) from a supply depot that could have saved his life. \"Great God! This is an awful place,\" he wrote. It has been more than a century since Scott died on that return journey and while many have since visited the South Pole, no one has ever even attempted to walk the entire round trip without a support team. \"It just seemed to be hanging out there as a journey that ought to be finished,\" says Saunders, who will attempt the feat. There will be no dogs, no support team. Just two men with 200kg sleighs walking across what Scott described as a \"slough of despond.\" A century on, Saunders and L'Herpiniere will still face the same brutal Antarctic conditions as Scott. They will have to negotiate ever-changing glaciers riddled with crevasses where temperatures plunge as low as -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit). But what they will have is state-of-the-art equipment and technology. \"We have clothing, equipment, food and technology that Scott could never have dreamed of,\" says Saunders. \"It actually has more in common with space flight than guys dragging wooden sleighs around.\" The ability to communicate could not only be potentially life-saving, but will also allow Saunders to upload blogs, video and photographs to the Scott Expedition website throughout what he hopes will be a ground-breaking four-month journey.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- France's Pierrick Fedrigo won stage 15 of the Tour de France on Monday, as Britain's Bradley Wiggins consolidated his hold on the leader's yellow jersey. The 158.5-kilometer ride between Samatan and Pau saw a further six riders withdraw from the race as cycling's premier event entered its third and final week. Fedrigo became the fourth Frenchman to win a stage at this year's race when he beat Christian Vande Velde in a sprint to the line in Pau. The two racers had surged ahead of the leading pack with 6.5 km to go. \"I don't know why I attacked, it was just instinct. But when Vande Velde stopped giving me relays in the last kilometer I knew that I would soon have to sprint,\" Fedrigo said. \"Thankfully, I've got a little more punch than him.\" Wiggins edged nearer to a place in the record books with a solid, if uninspiring, ride. No Englishman has won the Tour de France before, and Wiggins' Team Sky have made it clear they value the yellow jersey above the other titles on offer. Last year's green jersey winner Mark Cavendish would have expected to be part of the pack sprinting for a stage win, but he stuck to team orders and helped protect Wiggins as he rode to maintain his overall lead. The 32-year-old, who was born in Belgium where his Australian father was based, finished in the peloton 11 minutes and 50 seconds behind Fedrigo. Wiggins remained two minutes and five seconds ahead of teammate Chris Froome, with Italy's Vincenzo Nibali third at 2:23 behind and Australia's defending champion Cadel Evans fourth (3:19). The leader described Cavendish as \"a great champion and a great friend\" after the race, and admitted that his teammate had \"been so committed to my cause -- to the yellow jersey.\" Chasing down history: Wiggins' Tour quest . Team Sky will, however, try to give Olympic hopeful Cavendish a chance to win Sunday's final sprint stage in Paris. \"Obviously there is still the stage to Paris for him, and we're going to lay it down in Paris for him and try to get him the win there,\" Wiggins said. \"He's also got the Olympic road race, that's his main objective this year. In the end, we've got a difficult task on our hands to try to win the yellow jersey.\" With only five stages left in this year's Tour, the field is now down to 156 riders following 42 withdrawals. Sylvain Chavanel was Monday's most notable retiree. The French time trial champion was struggling to breathe as he felt the effects of a chest infection. \"He's lost his voice and he'd been finding it hard to breathe,\" explained his team Omega-Pharma's sporting director Brian Holm. \"This morning he was really sick. He spoke with the doctors of the team and they've advised him it would be best to pull out of the Tour.\" The riders have a rest day on Tuesday before resuming with a 197 km ride from Pau to Bagneres-du-Luchon, including four mountain climbs, on Wednesday.",

    "document": "Singapore (CNN) -- A Singapore court ruled Friday that four people can be extradited to the United States to face conspiracy charges after electronic components from a U.S. company were smuggled to Iran and ended up in explosives in Iraq. The case is part of an effort by the U.S. to link Iran with attacks on its forces in Iraq. The four Singaporeans -- three men and a woman -- were arrested in late October. They contested the extradition proceedings, and have 15 days to appeal. U.S. authorities indicted them, as well as an Iranian citizen, on charges of funneling thousands of radio frequency modules from the United States to Iran. The Iranian citizen, Hossein Larijani, remained at large at the time of the indictment. The United States alleges that 16 of the radio frequency modules were later found in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq that had not detonated. The explosive devices are often the weapon of choice for militants in Iraq, who regularly used them to attack U.S. and coalition convoys. David Adelman, the U.S. ambassador to Singapore, welcomed the ruling. \"This ruling reflects the strong spirit of cooperation between the United States and Singapore in combating transnational crime, including the illicit trade in arms and equipment that can pose significant threats to the United States and the international community,\" Adelman said in a statement. Following the court's decision Friday, two of the Singaporeans -- Lisingm Yong Nam and Wong Yuh Lan, the female suspect -- will be extradited to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in relation to the radio frequency modules. The other two -- Lim Kow Seng and Hia Soo Gan Benson -- will be sent to the United States to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States regarding the smuggling of dozens of military antennas, like those used on military aircraft and ships, from the United States to Hong Kong. Lim Yong Nam, Lim Kow Seng and Hia plan to appeal, their lawyer said. Wong's lawyer said he needed to talk to his client before saying whether she would appeal. In making a decision on the extradition, the judge, Chia Wee Kiat, weighed the evidence provided by the U.S. indictment, citing emails, documents and affidavits from the U.S. case. Chia said that if the alleged acts had indeed been committed, they would also be considered \"conspiracy and cheating under Singapore law.\" He noted that the Singapore court's role in considering the extradition request had been \"to decide whether there is a prima facie case.\" Chia said that \"the task of resolving doubt and weighing the evidence should be left to the trial judge.\" The U.S. indictment alleges that the Singaporeans conspired to buy 6,000 radio frequency modules from an unidentified company in Minnesota and ship them through Singapore to Larijani in Iran. The United States has in the past noted that Singapore -- a major global transshipment port -- needs to tighten its export controls, in particular of so-called \"dual use\" items, which can have both a civilian and military purpose . In this case, the radio frequency modules from the U.S. company have various commercial applications, including wireless local area networks to connect printers and computers in offices. The United States says that radio frequency modules from the same U.S. company were recovered in 2008 and 2009 by coalition forces in Iraq as part of remote detonation systems for improvised explosive devices. Prosecutors allege that the defendants told the Minnesota company that Singapore was the final destination for the components they were buying and also filed false paperwork with the U.S. government, saying the parts would be used in a Singapore telecommunications project. The Singaporeans have been held without bail since their arrest, except Lim Yong Nam, who was released on bail on medical grounds. They will all remain in prison until their extradition, except Lim Yong Nam, the judge said Friday.",
    "summary": "A Singapore judge says the four can be extradited . The United States has requested their extradition after an indictment . They are accused of illegally sending devices from a U.S. company to Iran . Prosecutors say the U.S. electronics turned up in undetonated improvised explosives in Iraq ."

Acknowledging the uncertainty that lies ahead, President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. will cooperate with Mexico in fighting drug-trafficking and organized crime in any way Mexico's government deems appropriate. He recommitted the U.S. to fighting the demand for illegal drugs and the flow of illegal guns across the border with Mexico even as the southern neighbor rethinks how much access it gives to U.S. security agencies. 'I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as the nature of that cooperation will evolve,' Obama said at a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. 'It is obviously up to the Mexican people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations — including the United States.'

Agenda: To sell his immigration overhaul back home, Obama (center) needs a growing economy in Mexico and a Mexican president willing to help him secure the border . Shaking hands: U.S. President Barack Obama (right) and his Mexican counterpart Enrique Pena Nieto shake hands as the president arrives in Mexico City . Obama's remarks come as Pina Nieto, in . a dramatic shift from his predecessor, has moved to end the widespread . access that U.S. security agencies have had in Mexico to help fight . drug-trafficking and organized crime. The White House has been cautious . in its public response to the changes, with the president and his . advisers saying they need to hear directly from the Mexican leader . before making a judgment about the new arrangement. Pina Nieto, speaking at the news . conference in Spanish, downplayed the notion that the new arrangement . would mean less close cooperation with the United States. 'There is no . clash between these two goals,' he said. He said Obama had said the U.S. will 'cooperate on the basis of mutual respect' to promote an efficient security strategy. The two leaders met Thursday at Mexico's National Palace on the first day of Obama's three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. To sell his immigration overhaul back . home, Obama needs a growing economy in Mexico and a Mexican president . willing to help him secure the border. He arrived in Mexico City eager to promote Mexico's economic success and the neighboring country's . place as the second largest export market for U.S. goods and services. Mexicans will be hanging on the American president's words, but Obama also has in mind an important audience back in the United States. Though the role played by Latino voters in last year's U.S. presidential election gets much credit for the current momentum for potentially changing immigration laws and providing a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, another reason for the change in attitudes is that stronger border protections and the recession have been disincentives to cross into the U.S. Tour: President Barack Obama (L) gets a tour of the National Palace in Mexico City from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto (right) Meeting: US President Barack Obama (L) and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto make their way to their seats for a bilateral meeting . Cruising: The presidential limousine with President Barack Obama inside drives past the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City's main plaza, the Zocalo . As a result, illegal immigration has declined. 'With Mexico, first and foremost, . they are critical to our ability to secure the border,' said Ben Rhodes, . an Obama deputy national security adviser. 'All . the immigration plans that have been contemplated put a focus on . securing the border as an essential priority and starting point for . immigration reform.' Even better than a strong border is an economy that keeps people from fleeing. 'If . the Mexican economy is growing, it forestalls the need for people to . migrate to the United States to find work,' Rhodes added. Eager to focus on the economy and immigration, the administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking and organized crime under his predecessor, Felipe Calderon. Still, the changes are likely to be a subject during the two leaders' private talks. Pena Nieto took office in December, and for Obama the trip is an opportunity to take his measure of the Mexican leader early in his tenure. 'It's really important to go there . while this new president is forming his own plans and judgments about . what he's going to do about the border, about where he's going to be on . immigration, about where he is on trade,' U.S. Chamber of Commerce . President/CEO Thomas Donohue said in an interview. The . chamber long has worked to improve U.S.-Mexico trade, noting that now . about 6 million U.S. jobs depend on commerce with Mexico. Drugs: A Mexican federal police officer stands next to packages, believed to be marijuana. The administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking . Striking the right note on border security is key, Donohue said, because it is a central to winning support in Congress for the rest of the immigration legislation. 'That's what everybody wants to hear, and we have to do that in a way that makes these guys down there feel like we're doing it in conjunction with them and for them, so we can do this thing on immigration well, so we can expand our trade, so we can deal with our political issues as they are trying to deal with theirs,' Donohue said. Still, with 33 million U.S. residents of Mexican origin, Obama's message in Mexico is also bound to resonate in the U.S., where Latinos could increase pressure on Congress to act. 'It helps keep these passions alive as far as an issue to promote for the administration,' said Carl Meacham, a former senior Latin America adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But Meacham, now director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that despite some bipartisan support to create a path to citizenship in the immigration bill, there is skepticism in Latin America. 'They've been brought to the altar so many times by different American administrations that there's a little bit of a lack of trust,' he said. For Pena Nieto, Obama's visit is a chance for him to showcase his country's economic gains. After suffering along with the U.S. during the recession, its economy is now growing at a better clip than that of the U.S. Per capita income has gone from an annual $7,900 two years ago to $10,146.",

Now her family and friends are desperately trying to find out what happened to Christina Marie Morris. Morris, 23, lives in Fort Worth but was visiting friends in Plano, about 50 miles away, when she disappeared on August 30, according to her family. Relatives reported her missing on Tuesday night, four days after she was last seen. Morris' parents filed a missing persons report on their daughter late Tuesday, according to police. Morris was last seen by a friend, who walked her to a parking garage at the Shops at Legacy mall just before 4 a.m., but he did not walk her all the way to her car, police said. She appears on surveillance video walking into the parking garage with the friend, police said. \"The guy ... is a friend of hers from high school. They had been at a friend's apartment hanging out and walked back together,\" Plano police spokesman David Tilley said Saturday. Police later found Morris' vehicle in the parking garage, but there was no sign of the woman. Her mother, Jonni McElroy, visited stores at the mall this week, desperately looking for anyone who may have seen Morris before she disappeared, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported. \"I'm not leaving. I will not leave here until I find clues to find my daughter,\" she told WFAA. Family and friends on Friday night also retraced Morris' steps, hoping to find answers to her whereabouts, the station said. Police said Morris' cell phone is either dead or turned off. \"We have been able to track the phone's last known location and that was in the Shops at Legacy,\" Tilley said.

'I spoke to him just before he caught the plane to find out when he was leaving and told him I loved him and told him I’d see him when he got back,' she told PerthNow.

The family were among the 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines plane, which departed from Amsterdam. Mr Norris had taken his three grandchildren, Mo, 12, Evie, 10, and Otis Maslin, eight, over to Europe so that they could join their parents, Mr Norris’s daughter Rin Norris and her partner Anthony Maslin for a holiday. After the three generations of the family had toured Europe for several weeks, Mr Norris was bringing his three grandkids back home to Perth in time for the start of school when they boarded the doomed flight. However, the parents had remained in Amsterdam for a few extra days. They were in the Dutch city as the tragic news broke. 'In my mind he was a very great man; he has been a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army Reserves; he’s been a headmaster; he’s been a consultant with Indigenous people with education and he has done his bit to change his part of the world,' Mrs Gemmell said of her father.

    "document": "A cargo of 20billion euros in cash (£16.75billion) has lain unclaimed at a Moscow airport for six years amid allegations it could be the secret fortune of Saddam Hussein. The stash, now under high security in a cargo depot, is held on 200 wooden pallets each worth 100 million euros, enough to keep the entire NHS going for almost two months. Russian customs have demanded the real owner of the booty \"presents himself\" to claim the fortune, but while a number of bogus and unconvincing attempts have been made to obtain it, no-one has satisfied the authorities that they are the rightful recipient. Under armed guard at Sheremetyevo airport in Russia there is £16.75bn in cash stored on wooden pallets . 'It is possible that this is the money of Saddam Hussein,' an anonymous intelligence source told Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper. The cash mountain, all in 100 euro notes, was flown to Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow from Frankfurt on 7 August 2007 and it has remained frozen there ever since. Russian sources say the authorities have failed to untangle the identity of the ultimate owner of the money, which - strangely - arrived at the airport without a specified recipient on the consignment. Why Saddam's ill-gotten nest egg would have been sent from Germany to Russia four years after he was toppled, and eight months after his execution, is unclear, but this is not the only theory about the money's origin. It is claimed that the Iraqi tyrant had shifted £7.5 billion to Moscow in diplomatic bags before he was ousted, yet this was far short of the full wealth he had amassed. Documents show Farzin Motlagh as the sender of the money but he has not come to claim the cash . Dead dictators: theories suggest the money could have actually belonged to either Saddam Hussein (left), former ruler of Iraq, or Colonel Gaddafi, who was shot following the Libyan uprising . 'There are other possibilities too,' said a security source last night. Saddam was not the only dictator who funnelled away a fortune: what about Muammar Gaddafi? 'Another explanation is that this is Russian mafia money or the fortune of corrupt Russian officials but that has become too dangerous for anyone to claim. It is a gargantuan sum.' The waybill, while not naming a recipient, suggested the owner was 45-year-old Farzin Koroorian Motlagh. His passport details show him to be Iranian, but Russian customs and other agencies appear far from convinced that he is the ultimate owner. Nor has he appeared in Moscow to claim the loot. Reports last night suggested that the cash was intended for an obscure foundation called The World of Kind People, yet its headquarters are Ukrainian and the final destination of the cash was Russia. It's boss, called Alexander Shipilov, 53, is one of a number of people who have failed to convince the authorities to hand him cash that would make him wealthier than Roman Abramovich, who is worth £9 billion. His charitable organisation is reported to have offered a two billion euro fee to lawyers to win the case, but Moscow's legal experts show no desire to take it on. Vadim Lyalin, a customs affairs expert, said: 'The shipper didn't specify a recipient. This is rather odd. It suggests that something is wrong with the cash. 'Surely someone would have claimed the cargo from the very beginning. It remains unknown who exactly did so. 'Probably, there was a certain plan how this cash was supposed to cross the Russian border since no-one with any sense would send such money to \"nowhere\". 'Something must have gone wrong, and \"Mr X\" failed to receive the cargo. After a number of failed attempts to collect the cash, it was decided to act via a foundation. 'This is a common money laundering practice.' Whoever manages to convince Russian authorities the money is theirs will be worth more than Roman Abramovich . The Russian government has so far not seized the money. Lyalin added: 'It turns out that there are no reasonable grounds for seizing it. 'The owner of the cash is named on paper. The cash is real and was transferred from a German bank.' The bank has been named as Deutsche Bank Group, though this is not confirmed. 'Customs demanded the owner of the cargo to appear in person,' said Lyalin. 'The authorities had to make sure that the owner was alive and is not a fake.' Motlagh (also known as Farzin Ali Karoryan Mutlaq) - who in 2010 was accused of being the \"mastermind\" of an attempt to steal $14billion from the Central Bank of Abu Dhabi using false documents - has not appeared in Moscow to stake his claim. He was reported to have avoided trial in the United Arab Emirates by fleeing to Iran. It is unclear if there is any link between the Abu Dhabi and Moscow cases, but in any event the Russians have rejected his attempts to use intermediaries to claim the cash. One source familiar with the situation said that a dozen groups have sought to claim the cash, all claiming to have Motlagh's authority. 'They include criminals, Chechen groups, and Ukrainian gangsters,' said the source. The security source claimed that Motlagh was a likely 'front man who lost control of a fortune he was nursing on behalf of shady interests related to a wicked dictator, corrupt senior officials, or a huge mafia operation linked to a state. We may never know to whom it belongs.'",

    "document": "By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Cuts: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in talks with NHS bosses about how to fill a £2bn gap . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in talks with NHS bosses about how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding. Senior sources say the ageing population, the cost of new drugs and the rising pensions bill for staff has left the health service in England with the shortfall for next year. Chris Ham, head of the King’s Fund think tank, said there was a ‘real risk’ some hospitals could run out of money unless they received a significant cash injection. ‘Everywhere you look across the NHS there are pressures facing patient care,’ he told the BBC, which obtained the £2billion figure. ‘They’re having to find even bigger efficiency savings to balance the books and deliver good standards of patient care. That’s a very, very big ask.’ The NHS budget for England for 2015 is around £100billion. David Cameron has not ring-fenced spending on the health service and its budget has risen only by the rate of inflation – without taking into account the rising population and other cost pressures. Mr Cameron played down concerns at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, saying efficiency targets for the NHS had been met every year, and the cash ploughed back into frontline care. Anita Charlesworth of the Health Foundation think tank said the health service had been doing well at making savings. But she added: ‘There is a “pincer” – as the NHS takes on more nurses, drug prices are rising and their pension costs are rising, as part of government policy. 'We’re not going to find this money behind the sofa, so it would mean the Treasury stepping in. If it can’t do that, we’re faced with cutting services and cutting quality.’ The Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is on track to make £20billion savings this parliament and we are confident it will continue to make the savings necessary to meet rising demand.’ Meanwhile, some Liberal Democrat ministers are understood to be pushing for an increase in the NHS budget. Proposals: GPs rejected a move to charge patients for appointments to improve attendance (file photo) Leader Nick Clegg is being lobbied by those who think the party should call for more borrowing or spending cuts elsewhere to fund vital health services. A source said: ‘We could differentiate ourselves from the Conservatives on something the public really care about for a change.’ GPs and nurses’ leaders have suggested charging patients for appointments, in part to save money. Earlier this year, GPs held a vote on charging for appointments at the British Medical Association’s local medical committee conference in York. The idea was to deter patients from missing consultations – a problem that costs £160million a year. The fees – possibly between £10 and £25 – would be the first since the NHS was founded in 1948. Although the GPs rejected the idea, it has not gone away. Yesterday the Royal College of Nursing’s annual conference in Liverpool debated whether patients should be charged up to £10 for seeing their GP. Nurses who put forward the motion said that NHS finances were ‘not infinite’. Once again, the motion was defeated. But its very presence on the conference agenda show it is an increasingly live issue.",

The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.

De Klerk, another laureate, backed Tutu, saying in a statement that he would also not participate in the conference if the Dalai Lama remained excluded. De Klerk said that the decision to refuse the visa made a \"mockery\" of the peace conference. \"The decision to exclude the Dalai Lama is irreconcilable with key principles on which our society is based including the principles of accountability, openness and responsiveness and the rights to freedom of expression and free political activity,\" he said. \"South Africa is a sovereign constitutional democracy and should not allow other countries to dictate to it regarding who it should, and should not admit to its territory - regardless of the power and influence of the country.\" A representative of the Dalai Lama said he was not surprised by the decision.

The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The peace conference was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa's role as a human-rights champion ahead of its hosting of soccer's World Cup next year. It was to bring together Noble Laureates and top soccer officials.

Quaid’s lawyer, Lorne Waldman, told CBC News that the officer mentioned in the document ignored evidence that Qauid and his wife were in danger. Quaid withdrew his refugee claim last summer and immigration authorities have since denied his resubmittal.

Quaid completed a notice of withdrawal in August 2012. He said he didn't know what he was doing at the time. ‘He never intended to withdraw his refugee claim,’ legal documents state. ‘His wife suffers from dyslexia and post-traumatic stress disorder and she reacted out of fear when she completed the withdrawal form.’ The Quaids now say their lives are in danger again.

    "document": "(CNN) -- Police in Paris are searching for a self-proclaimed porn star suspected of killing and cutting up a university student in Canada, authorities in Montreal said Sunday. Police Cmdr. Ian LaFreniere said sightings of the suspect, 29-year-old Luka Rocco Magnotta, are being investigated in Paris, but that he could be anywhere. Montreal authorities on Saturday detailed the charges pending against Magnotta, accusing him of first-degree murder in the grisly killing and dismembering of the student and threatening, among others, Canada's prime minister. The search for him began after a severed hand and foot were mailed to the Ottawa headquarters of Canada's Liberal and Conservative parties, while a torso was discovered stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash heap of a Montreal apartment building. What specific accusations he would face if he's captured became clearer Saturday, when police in Montreal released information from his arrest warrant. Besides murder, the charges include producing, distributing or possessing \"any obscene written matter, picture, model ... or other thing,\" mailing \"anything that is obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous,\" and \"improperly or indecently (offering) any indignity to a dead human body or human remains.\" The accusations relate to the violent death of a Concordia University student from China. Lafreniere identified the victim Friday as 33-year-old Jun Lin. The Chinese consulate in Montreal said Lin was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Police believe Lin was killed and his body dismembered either on May 24 or 25 in a Montreal apartment. A 10-minute video showing what transpired was then posted online. \"We believe he filmed himself,\" Lafreniere said earlier this week of the suspect. \"It's gross ... This is a very deranged person. He is looking for attention and he got it, but not in a positive way.\" According to a more detailed copy of the arrest warrant posted on the website of CNN affiliate CBC, the fifth charge of \"uttering threats\" accuses Magnotta of \"causing (Prime Minister) Stephen Harper and members of parliament to reasonably fear for their safety.\" Harper is the leader of the Conservative party, one of the offices that had body parts mailed to it. Magnotta, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, fled by plane from Montreal to Europe, Lafreniere has said. That prompted Interpol, the global police agency, to alert authorities in 190 countries. On Friday, police had indications that the suspect may have been aboard a flight traveling from Paris to Montreal. Yet there was no sign of him after a search of the plane, Lafreniere said. Having earlier indicated that Magnotta is good at disguising himself, the police commander said Saturday that the suspect could now be anywhere in Europe, though authorities haven't ruled out the possibility he may be back in Canada. Police described Magnotta as being 5 feet, 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds, with black hair and blue eyes. His name may not have been known before this week, but his digital footprints were large. He was notorious among online animal rights activists, who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used cat carcasses in sexual acts. Suspect in body parts probe described as 'creepy' and a kitten-killer . A Facebook group started in December 2010 dubbed him the \"Vacuum Kitten Killer,\" after a video was posted on YouTube showing kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning. \"Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual, who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed,\" the group said Thursday. \"Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals.\" Lafreniere has said police are aware of the animal abuse allegations. On what appears to be his own website, Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking. \"Once and for all, I will set the record straight,\" he wrote. \"Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact.\" The website has writing in Arabic and Russian, and shows images of Magnotta half-naked and with lips in a distinct runway pout. Lafreniere from the Montreal police expressed confidence that Magnotta will be caught sooner or later -- predicting his desire for attention may be his downfall. \"This man uses the Web to glorify himself, and (authorities) hope this habit will lead to his capture,\" the police commander said Saturday. CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this report.",

    "document": "By . Associated Press . A man who supplied nearly 10 pounds of methamphetamine to a drug operation run by a Catholic priest dubbed Monsignor Meth was sentenced Wednesday to more than five years in prison, telling a judge he was overcome by his addiction and never intended to become such a big dealer. Chad McCluskey, 44, was sentenced to five years, five months behind bars for his role in a massive meth operation . Chad McCluskey, 44, of San Clemente, California, was sentenced in federal court in Hartford to five years, five months behind bars. He and his girlfriend, Kristen Laschober, of Laguna Niguel, California, pleaded guilty last year to drug conspiracy charges connected to their meth business with now-suspended Monsignor Kevin Wallin. Laschober awaits sentencing. Wallin, nicknamed Monsignor Meth in some media reports, also pleaded guilty to a federal drug charge and awaits sentencing. He is facing 11 to 14 years in prison for selling large quantities of meth out of his apartment in Waterbury. Two other men pleaded guilty to helping Wallin sell the drugs in Connecticut. 'I would like to apologize to the court for my conduct and to the communities I've hurt,' McCluskey said in court, crying at times. 'And to my friends who stood by me ... and to my family. ... I didn't think it was going to be a business, and my addiction got so heavy that my judgment was clouded. ... I never set out to be a drug dealer.' Authorities said McCluskey started sending small amounts of meth to Wallin in early 2009, and the operation grew before it ended in late 2012, shortly before everyone was arrested. Federal officials say McCluskey and Laschober sent 1 to 3 pounds a month to Wallin over six months. McCluskey also admitted distributing at least 12 pounds of meth to drug sellers in another part of the country. McCluskey once supplied ten pounds of methamphetamine to a priest dealer known as Monsignor Meth . McCluskey grew up near Chicago, graduated from Drake University in Iowa and held good jobs before his drug addiction did him in, said his lawyer, Todd Bussert. Wallin, 62, had been the pastor at St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport for nine years before resigning in 2011, citing health and personal problems. He previously served as pastor of St. Peter's Church in Danbury. The Diocese of Bridgeport indefinitely revoked Wallin's priest powers in 2012. Connecticut police and federal agents said they also discovered during their investigation that Wallin had bought an adult video and sex-toy shop in North Haven, apparently to launder all the money he was making. Wallin's case drew comparisons to the TV show 'Breaking Bad,' about a high school science teacher who became a meth kingpin. McCluskey grew up near Chicago, graduated from Drake University in Iowa and held good jobs before his drug addiction did him in, said his lawyer, Todd Bussert (not pictured) Authorities say the case was unusual because methamphetamine hasn't been a big problem in the state as it has in others. In fact, officials said Wallin's case was the first federal prosecution of a meth case in Connecticut that they could remember. Bussert said McCluskey had a long-standing drug problem. 'This isn't a guy who woke up one day and decided to break bad,' Bussert said.",

    "document": "Washington (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama found herself at the center of an unlikely breast-feeding debate this week when three prominent conservative women criticized her for encouraging the creation of a \"nanny state.\" Conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday asked Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, about an announcement by the Internal Revenue Service that the purchase of breast-feeding equipment would be considered a medical expense. Ingraham suggested that the first lady's advocacy of breast-feeding as a way to fight childhood obesity might have been \"coordinated\" with the IRS decision. Bachmann, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's policies, was quick to point out that the decision falls in line with the \"hard left\" agenda. \"I think this is very consistent with where the hard left is coming from,\" Bachmann said. \"For them, government is the answer to every problem. So government got us in this problem, and so they think government is going to get us out of the problem. \"I've given birth to five babies and I breast-fed every single one of these babies, and to think that the government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies. I mean, you want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny.\" At an event in New York on Thursday, Sarah Palin joined the conversation -- although somewhat lightheartedly. \"No wonder Michelle Obama is telling people to breast-feed their babies, because the price of milk is rising so high,\" Palin joked, later warning reporters, \"That better not be the takeaway here.\" The controversy stems from an IRS announcement earlier this month that breast pumps and other breast-feeding supplies would qualify for reimbursement as a medical expense under federal tax law. Previously, new mothers who set aside pre-tax money in health savings accounts, or who itemized their medical expenses at tax time, were prohibited from filing claims for money spent on breast-feeding equipment. As for the question of whether politics played any role in the IRS decision, spokespeople for the IRS and the Treasury Department said the decision was a legal one made by the IRS general counsel's office. Two days before the IRS announcement, Obama held a lunch with print reporters to celebrate the first anniversary of her \"Let's Move\" campaign to fight childhood obesity. When asked what plans she had for the campaign's second year, the first lady said, \"Breast-feeding. Kids who are breast-fed longer have a lower tendency to be obese.\" Five months earlier, she used nearly identical language in a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus' annual legislative conference. \"Because it's important to prevent obesity early, we're also working to promote breast-feeding, especially in the black community, where 40% of our babies never get breast-fed at all, even in the first weeks of life,\" she said in September. \"And we know that babies that are breast-fed are less likely to be obese as children.\" While the extent to which breast-feeding affects obesity is still unknown, some connection between the two is largely accepted. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics lobbied the IRS directly on the matter because of what it says are the \"diverse and compelling advantages for infants, mothers, families and society from breast-feeding and use of human milk for infant feeding.\" More specifically, the academy's 2005 policy statement on breast-feeding found that \"some studies suggest decreased rates of ... overweight and obesity... in older children and adults who were breast-fed, compared with individuals who were not breast-fed.\" A 2007 report on breast-feeding from Tufts-New England Medical Center found that \"there is an association between a history of breast-feeding and a reduction in the risk of being overweight or obese in adolescence and adult life,\" along with a variety of other health benefits. When asked if her problem with the IRS decision stemmed from a belief that breast-feeding shouldn't be in the same category as other medical expenses, Bachmann's office issued a statement that refocused her criticism on the federal tax code. \"The issue Americans have with the tax code isn't with one specific tax deduction,\" the statement said. \"Instead of social-engineering through select tax breaks, the government should scrap the current tax code and put all Americans on the same playing field.\" The IRS has a fairly broad interpretation of the term \"medical expenses\" in the federal tax code, including wigs, acupuncture, artificial teeth, eyeglasses, contact lenses, certain home improvements, lead-based paint removal and television equipment for the hearing-impaired as deductible expenses. The cost of the IRS announcement is hard to estimate. Although the IRS provides broad instructions, individual insurance companies set their own guidelines for what is covered under health savings accounts. Additionally, only one-third of taxpayers itemize their deductions, and medical expenses need to exceed 7.5% of income in order to qualify for deduction. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation called the announcement a \"regulatory decision\" and has not prepared any public information on the issue. A 2010 cost analysis of low breast-feeding levels published in the American Academy of Pediatrics' medical journal Pediatrics found that if 90% of U.S. families followed medical recommendations to breast-feed for six months, \"The United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess (of) 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants.\"",

    "document": "An elderly stroke patient was left lying in her own urine in a cold ward on Christmas Day, it was claimed today. Elsie Keirl, 84, was admitted to Musgrove Park Hospital - which has since launched an investigation - in Taunton, Somerset, a day after she had a stroke at her home in nearby Brigwater. Her son David Keirl, 58, stayed with her until Christmas morning before returning home for a few hours’ rest - but found on his return that his mother was ‘blue’ because her room was so cold. 'Left lying in her own urine': Elsie Keirl, 84, was admitted to hospital a day after she had a stroke at her home . Mr Keirl also claimed nurses failed to turn the pensioner for ten hours and left her lying in her own urine. The son said he was speaking out ‘because I don’t want this to happen to anyone else’. He said: ‘She spent her last Christmas in a freezing cold room with inadequate bedding, lying in her own urine. There must be thousands of old people without anyone to fight for them.’ Mrs Keirl was initially taken to hospital by ambulance at 9pm on Christmas Eve after falling ill at her home. Mr Keirl followed close behind and stayed with her until 6am on Christmas Day. He returned at 11am, just five hours later, when he found his mother - who also has another son - in a cold side room, with no heating and just one blanket. In hospital: Mrs Keirl (above) is claimed to have turned partially ‘blue’ while the rest of her had gone ‘white’ Despite his repeated requests, Mrs Keirl was not moved from the room and the air conditioning system remained on, further lowering the temperature. He claims that as a result, she had turned partially ‘blue’ and the rest of her had gone ‘white’. Mr Keirl said: ‘She was quite settled in the medical assessment unit and they said there was nothing I could do so I went home to get a few hours’ sleep. ‘I got back at 11.30am and when I walked into the side room of the ward where she was it was absolutely freezing cold, like an ice box. Her lips were blue and her ears were white. ‘There was an air vent I think, blowing out cold air. I asked for it to be turned off and was told it couldn’t be. The radiator was cold and I was told they were on a timer and would come on later. Probe: Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Somerset, has launched an investigation following the incident . ‘There was one blanket on her, but her arms and legs and chest were sticking out and I kept asking for more blankets and kept explaining that at home she likes to be kept warm. ‘She should have been turned every two or three hours but at about 2pm to 3pm I thought, no one is turning her. When I felt in the bed it was really wet.’ After his complaints, Mrs Keirl was moved to a new room, where she is in a ‘fragile’ state. The hospital’s chief executive, Jo Cubbon, has now spoken to Mr Keirl and his family to apologise. Its deputy chief executive, Peter Lewis, added that if the claims were true then the allegations were very serious. A Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said that she could not comment while an investigation was under way. This probe is due to be concluded in the next few days.",

    "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:19 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:27 EST, 13 January 2014 . The driver of the train that derailed in New York last month, killing four people and injuring dozens more, had consistently been working a demanding overtime schedule in the years leading up to last month’s fatal derailment, payroll records have shown. William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the crash, worked an average of 762 overtime hours per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to MTA data. On the basis that Metro-North drivers work a typical 40-hour work week of five eight-hour shifts, that's the equivalent of working a sixth day every week for three years straight. William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the Metro-North crash in early December, has worked an average of six days a week for the past three years . The reliance on overtime scheduling along the Metro-North line has been described as ‘shocking’ by U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, a Democrat who represents the Bronx district where the train derailed. As well as requesting payroll records for Rockefeller, NBC New York also requested information for 20 of the highest paid Metro-North engineers in 2010, 2011 and 2012. They found that one train operator worked 1,183 overtime hours in 2011, which works out to an average of 23 hours of overtime every week. Another top overtime earner made a staggering $71,000 in overtime on top of $98,000 in regular pay in 2011. That works out to 1,222 overtime hours in a single year or the equivalent of working eight days a week. Horrifying: The high-speed train derailment that killed four people has led the MTA to adopt several new safety measures . The records show that Rockefeller earned almost $45,000 in overtime pay in 2012, almost double the $23,000 average for Metro-North engineers that year. Union rules allow the most senior Metro-North train operators to have first claim on overtime hours, but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime, while others get relatively few extra shifts. Engel has said that he will ask the federal government to make recommendations on reforming overtime rules for train operators. ‘It may be that people will have to be hired, because obviously if there are shifts people are working - all kinds of hours, day-in, day-out, month-in, month-out, year-in, year-out – it’s not good for anybody,’ he said. An MTA spokesman stressed to NBC that Metro-North fully complies with hours of service rules enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration. Union rules allow the most senior Metro-North train operators to have first claim on overtime hours, but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime . Rockefeller claims he fell into 'a hypnosis-like daze' when his train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of New York while travelling at 82 mph at the beginning of December. His lawyer Jeffrey Chartier said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘a daze,’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis. He couldn't say how long it lasted. What Rockefeller remembers is ‘operating the train, coming to a section where the track was still clear - then, all of a sudden, feeling something was wrong and hitting the brakes,’ Chartier said. ‘... He felt something was not right, and he hit the brakes.’ He called Rockefeller ‘a guy with a stellar record who, I believe, did nothing wrong.’ ‘You've got a good guy and an accident,’ he said. ‘... A terrible accident is what it is.’ Rockefeller ‘basically nodded,’ said Anthony Bottalico, leader of the rail employees union, relating what he said the engineer told him. ‘He had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car,’ Bottalico said. ‘That is, you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that might be.’ In the wake of the crash, investigators quickly determined that the deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with the train itself as the driver had originally claimed.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- North Korea said Saturday any sanctions or pressure applied against it following its rocket launch earlier this month will be considered a \"declaration of war.\" A North Korean soldier looks into South Korea from the demilitarized zone on April 9. In an announcement on state-run television, the country said it was ready to step up efforts to develop nuclear weapons and poised for a military response to any moves against it. \"The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are always keeping themselves fully ready to go into action any moment to mercilessly punish anyone who encroaches upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit,\" it said. On Monday the United Nations condemned North Korea -- which refers to itself as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK -- for launching a rocket. The United States called the launch a \"provocative act\" that violated a 2006 Security Council resolution prohibiting Pyongyang from conducting ballistic missile launches. Pyongyang insists the April 5 launch was a successful mission to place a communications satellite into orbit. The United States says the rocket's payload did not reach orbit. The U.N. statement says the rocket launch was \"in contravention\" to a 2006 Security Council resolution that demanded that North Korea not launch any ballistic missiles. The 15-member council also voted unanimously for a statement by the council's president demanding the country make no more launches. \"The Korean People's Army will consider sanctions to be applied against the DPRK under various names over its satellite launch or any pressure to be put upon it through 'total participation' in the PSI (Proliferation Security Initiative) as a declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war against the DPRK,\" the announcement on state TV said. \"Now that the group officially declared confrontation and war against the DPRK, its revolutionary armed forces will opt for increasing the nation's defense capability including nuclear deterrent in every way, without being bound to the agreement adopted at the six-party talks,\" it continued, apparently referring to the Security Council. Referring to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, the statement added, \"The Lee group of traitors should never forget that Seoul is just 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from the Military Demarcation Line.\" That line was established by the 1953 Armistice Agreement between the two Koreas -- which are still technically at war. A Friday report North Korea's official KCNA news agency, seemed to blame the \"war hysteria\" on the United States and South Korea after the two countries carried out a combined air force operation in South Korea. The \"'South Korea-U.S. military alliance' oft-repeated by them is, in essence, nothing but a 'war alliance' and 'alliance for aggression' aimed at invading the DPRK,\" the report said. \"When a nuclear war will break out due to the war chariot of the 'South Korea-U.S. military alliance' is a matter of time,\" it said. \"The U.S. and South Korean warmongers would be well advised to stop acting rashly, properly understanding who their rival is.\"",

The two Leveson lawyers who went on holiday to a Greek island during the media standards inquiry may face an investigation by the barristers’ disciplinary body. A senior MP yesterday wrote to the Bar Standards Board asking it to examine Daily Mail revelations about the affair between celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne and Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team. The couple admit going to Santorini – apparently only to ‘discuss the possibility of a future relationship’ – but claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November. Affair: Mr Sherborne, a barrister who represented Hugh Grant, and Mrs Patry Hoskins, a member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team, claim their relationship did not start until after the inquiry . But Rob Wilson, a Tory MP and aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, wants the board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the Bar’s code of conduct. Mr Wilson, who has already asked Lord Justice Leveson to investigate the barristers’ affair, said: ‘It is only right that an inquiry into breaches of ethical standards be seen to be completely above board itself. ‘If there have been breaches of the legal profession’s ethical code of conduct by members of the Leveson Inquiry team, these must be accounted for to the public. ‘If this affair isn’t investigated promptly and properly, it risks becoming a stain on the reputation of the Leveson Inquiry.’ Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, and 40-year-old Mrs Patry Hoskins did not tell Lord Justice Leveson about their affair and he only learnt of their trip to Santorini in recent days. Not informed: Lord Justice Leveson was not told about the affair and only learned about the couple's holidaying together in the past week . A spokesman for the judge said yesterday: ‘Lord Justice Leveson understands that the Bar Standards Board is aware of the recent Press reports. It is a matter for the board to decide what, if any, action to take.’ MP letter: Rob Wilson wants Bar Standards Board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the code of conduct . Bar Council guidelines warn barristers it is very unwise to have relationships with counsel involved in the same case because clients might perceive ‘a danger of breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. That would be likely to breach the lawyers’ code of conduct. It prohibits barristers from acting ‘where by reason of any connection with the client, the court, or otherwise’, a barrister’s professional independence ‘might be compromised or there might be prejudice or the appearance of prejudice to the administration of justice’. In his letter, Mr Wilson asks the board to investigate whether there have been several breaches of the code. These include engaging in conduct likely to diminish public confidence in the legal profession or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute, a requirement to act with independence and not to do anything that may lead to any inference that a barrister’s independence may be compromised. The Bar Standards Board will normally carry out an initial assessment before deciding whether to undertake a formal investigation which could lead to a disciplinary tribunal. The board can impose punishments ranging from words of advice, fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off. Calls for an investigation came after it emerged that Mr Sherborne and mother-of-two Mrs Patry Hoskins went to Santorini last August, days after the public hearings concluded and months before the inquiry ended. Father-of-three Mr Sherborne represented Hugh Grant and other phone-hacking victims at the Leveson Inquiry. Glamorous brunette Mrs Patry Hoskins, nicknamed the ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the £6million inquiry on behalf of the public.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Anyone who uses a smartphone, puts away money in a 401(k), or wants to keep their grocery bill from skyrocketing needs to be aware of a new dynamic in the world economy. It's called the \"Plan B World\" and it is about how modern shocks to systems in far corners of the world are now having a direct impact on local employment and economies, including the parts that go into cell phones, the financial markets that house our retirement savings and the global agriculture system. We saw the downside of single-source supply contracting and just-in-time inventory systems when a manufacturing plant for a certain type of gasket was destroyed in the 2011 Japanese tsunami. It led to the shutdown of production facilities in the big six automakers in the United States, which weakened the economy and contributed to the U.S. unemployment rate increasing from 8.9% to 9.1% during this time. If carmakers had a Plan B for gasket supply, an economic disruption that put factory employees out of work could have been avoided. Advancements in supply chain technology have improved efficiency and lowered the prices we pay for goods and services. But without a mindset that recognizes that we are in a Plan B world, we are less resilient to the acute shocks and chronic stresses our world faces every day. The Plan B mindset will allow us to use our creativity to proactively plan for more resilient solutions. By that I mean developing ways that people, communities, industries and even nations are better able to rebound in the face of adversity and come back even stronger. What makes this important? The speed of change -- along with the increasing environmental, economic, social and political volatility -- has led to crises of intensifying frequency, scale and severity, with potentially catastrophic effects that cascade across sectors and geographies. A reality of our time is that we cannot anticipate every catastrophe or stressful event. We can -- and must -- do what we can to prevent bad things from happening, but the fact remains that surprises will still happen. Ominous recent episodes demand we always have a Plan B that minimizes the lasting effects of a range of future threats and allows us to rebound more quickly and effectively: . • Climate catastrophes, like the deadly floods that paralyzed Thailand in 2011, can trigger disruptions to the world's tenuous manufacturing supply chain. When the autumn flooding in Bangkok closed factories that fed global manufacturers, it forced shutdowns of electronics and automotive assembly lines from Shanghai to Shenzen to Shreveport. • Financial contagion, like the debt crises of Greece and Portugal in 2010 and 2011, can shatter confidence in global financial markets. Losses inflicted by the European crises reversed years' worth of painstaking economic progress for nations and individuals worldwide. • Food shortages, like the drought-induced famine emergency in Somalia and Ethiopia in 2011, can cause food riots locally and speculative panics globally. Such market gyrations can contribute to protectionist measures that drive worldwide food-price spikes and further punish the most vulnerable. • True natural disasters, like last year's Japanese earthquake and tsunami, can expose dangers in nationwide planning systems and calamities in power and other sectors. The sudden discovery of structural weakness in many of Japan's nuclear power plants forced the shutdown of its nuclear electricity network, with the power outage provoking an economic stall. • Disease pandemics, like the SARS outbreak that swept through Asia in 2002 and 2003, can spread infections across borders as fast as 747s can ferry passengers across oceans. • Cyberattacks and hacking can undermine public faith in the secure data that supports global commerce. Further, the infiltration of infrastructure networks and military systems can compromise national security. A Plan B would not just build higher levees and a more regulated banking system. It would look at ways of setting up redundant systems so that when one system fails another takes up some of the slack. Or when we design our flood or economic plans, can we keep in mind ways to prevent cascading failures when one part of the system collapses? There are already some Plan Bs being put in place. Two examples come from work that the Rockefeller Foundation is supporting today. • In Ethiopia, some of the poorest subsistence farmers in the country are receiving crop insurance through an innovative program spearheaded by Oxfam America that allows farmers to trade work for insurance. This makes farmers more resilient against drought, famine and floods. • The Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network is a 10-city initiative to develop climate resilience strategies appropriate to each city. One of the cities where the program is operating is Danang, Vietnam. Their strategy included hydrology mapping, which led the city to halt building plans in vulnerable areas and has shaped the city's future development plans. This planning will reduce the vulnerability of people and property to the effects of climate changes. This is only a start. How we strengthen Plan Bs and interconnect them is the focus of a meeting this week in Washington that is bringing together global leaders and thinkers across an array of fields. From these discussions, a clearer way forward will be developed, that will be followed by grants aimed at achieving this goal. This is just one step toward a more resilient world. It is long past time for everyone to work together to reinforce society's complex systems at their most vulnerable points. We are on our way.

    "document": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Kim Jong Un cut a somber figure Monday, marking the first anniversary of his father's death. North Korea said Kim Jong Il died of a heart attack from overwork on December 17, 2011. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers assembled outside the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang where the bodies of Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung lie. Read more: North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . Accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, who appeared to be heavily pregnant, Kim Jong Un bowed to giant statues of the former leaders inside the mausoleum. Outside, he listened to a commemorative speech from Choe Ryong-hae, head of the military's political arm. Choe praised the achievements of the former leaders before declaring, \"Kim Jong Un is North Korea's fate and future.\" A lot has changed over the past year. Kim Jong Un has transformed from grieving son to a triumphant leader leading a controversial rocket launch this month. The 20-something leader, who was suddenly thrust into the limelight last December was considered by many outside, and possibly even inside, North Korea to be ill-prepared for the responsibilities that lay ahead. But experts say it was soon clear that the younger Kim would not be emulating the style of his father. \"Kim Jong Il was rather low profile for a few years after the death of Kim Il Sung which is in accordance with even older Confucian practices,\" says John Delury assistant professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. \"This is after all a dynastic system, but Kim Jong Un quickly proved by the spring that he was going to be quite public, quite active.\" April 2012 brought with it one of the most significant dates on the North Korean calendar, as it marked the centenary of the birth of the country's founder Kim Il Sung, celebrations for which had been planned for years by the late Kim Jong Il. His son picked up the mantle and controversially launched a rocket in commemoration. Following his father's example, Kim ignored international condemnation for what he called an attempt to put a working satellite into orbit. Washington, Seoul and others in the region saw the launch as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. Read more: Experts: Rocket launch bolsters North Korean leader . The rocket was a failure, made all the more public by the international media which had been invited into the country for the occasion. But disregarding the international embarrassment, Kim Jong Un continued with the celebrations. \"He actually performed quite well by the standard set for him,\" says Delury. \"He spoke in public which is something his father did not and he projected a kind of confidence and energy, he really turned the young and experienced to his advantage.\" The world and the people of North Korea heard the voice of the new leader for the very first time. Even more surprising was Kim's acknowledgment of his people's suffering. He told a gathering of hundreds of thousands, \"Our Party is determined our people will not have to tighten their belts but will enjoy wealth and the honor of socialism.\" Style-wise, Kim cuts a very different figure to his father. He is more personable and willing to interact with his people. He is often seen smiling and laughing and his wife has accompanied him on many field trips, which was unheard of during his father's reign. Read more: Is Kim Jong Un's uncertainty driving the rockets? \"She's played a very surprising role in constructing this image of a looser, more relaxed, more open leader domestically,\" adds Delury. But despite a softer side appearing on camera, little has improved for the people of North Korea. Aid groups say malnutrition is still rampant in the countryside, brutal labor camps still remain and defector groups in Seoul claim Kim has cracked down even harder on people trying to escape. They say the leader has threatened to imprison or even kill three generations of the family left behind. It's a claim CNN cannot independently confirm. Kim has made his mark on the military, replacing some generals loyal to his father with those loyal to him. \"Certainly everyone has noticed a number of the key military figures, you know four who walked with Kim Jong Il's remains a year ago have sort of disappeared from the scene or have been reshuffled.\" But his statements on the South Korean or American leadership remain just as bellicose as during the his father's era and he frequently visits military barracks and installations. Read more: What is life like inside North Korea? Speculation about internal displeasure among some of those replaced by Kim Jong Un may be easing since last week's successful rocket launch, the second attempt in a year. \"I think it earned him a lot of patriotic points,\" says Jasper Kim, founder of Asia-Pacific Global research Group. \"So that will basically placate the military so this will give him extra room to maneuver in terms of making modernization efforts if that's his plan.\" Kim Jong Un's use of the media has been a drastic departure from his father's time. Live broadcasts and televised public speeches are no longer so unusual. Jasper Kim adds, \"Kim Jong Un basically grew up on Google and his father grew up on letters and stamps. It's a new era and Kim Jong Un realizes the more he can kind of shape the narrative to the international community, the more it is to his benefit in terms of getting security and money and everything else that he wants for his country.\"",

    "document": "If you are going to get ahead in life, it seems every little girl and little boy needs a Pank in their life. A Pank will smother them with love and advice and buy them the very latest and expensive must-have toys which will ensure their ongoing popularity with their friends. Sociologists, always on the lookout for a new acronym, have coined a fresh one - Pank - a professional aunt, no kids. Doting: Panks smother their nieces and nephews with love and advice and buy them the very latest and expensive must-have toys . And among the notable Panks smothering their nieces and nephews with love and enviable gifts is actress, Cameron Diaz. Diaz, who has no children, was present at the birth of all her three nieces and admits she spoils them rotten. The 41-year-old actress says: ‘Whatever they want, they get. I cannot resist. But being an aunt is the most important role in my life.’ Jennifer Aniston, 44, who is merely a godmother to Coco Arquette, the daughter of her Friends’ co-star Courtney Cox, says that although she doesn’t have children herself she too dotes ‘like a mother, or at least an aunt’ with the eight-year-old. 'I cannot resist': Cameron Diaz, who has no children, admits she spoils her three nieces rotten . She said of the little girl who calls her Nuna: ‘She is very precious to me and we share confidences.’ The stars are the latest to acknowledge the power of the professional, childless aunt who has surplus love and money to lavish on their pampered niblings. The image of the doting, slightly dotty aunt has been a British stereotype since the Victorian age, . But today Panks are anything but dotty or eccentric and are likely to be working in well-paid top level jobs. And they are becoming more and more visible in the sociological make-up of the British family because more women are choosing to focus on their professional careers and put off having children until later. Jane Pilcher, a sociology lecturer at the University of Leicester, told the Sunday Times: ‘Those who have put off having children might give expression to their nurturing side through the children of their siblings. ‘And they might be glad to spend surplus money on them.’ she added. Last week research by Euromonitor, a global marketing research firm, suggested American Panks were spoiling their nieces and nephews to the tune of £6bn a year. And with more and more women choosing to concentrate on their careers in the UK - Britons not far behind. For every Pank there is also a Punk - professional uncle, no children - and actor Jake Gyllenhaal, 32, is the perfect example. The actor says some of his best evenings are spent babysitting his sister Maggie’s, children. Motherly: Jennifer Aniston, 44, dotes on goddaughter Coco Arquette, right, who is the daughter of Courtney Cox . He said: ‘Ramona and Gloria Ray are the cure for the Hollywood day.’ Though he admitted he has yet to become an expert in choosing presents for the two youngsters. Melanie Notkin, 44, a marketing consultant, founded the website SavvyAuntie with the idea of fixing just such a problem. She said: ‘People imagine us knitting or eating food out of a can while watching TV, but really these days we are more like the cool aunt who exposes a child to cultural experiences that their parents might not have the time and money for.’ She said around three out of every four Panks spent around £300 a year on their nephews and nieces and the sum is rising. Babysitter: Jake Gyllenhaal, pictured with his sister Maggie, is the perfect example of a Punk - professional uncle, no children . The Office for National Statistics this year published figures showing that one in five British women is childless at 45. The figure compares with one in eight childless women among what could be described as their mothers’ generation – those born on the eve of the Second World War in 1939. The proportion of women who do not have babies has not been so high since 1920, when many were denied marriage and family by the loss of so many men in the First World War.",

Amazingly, visiting this seventh wonder of the world became possible thanks to the kindness of a complete stranger. Chris Cice, who works for Alaska Airlines as a pilot, was told about Ben's condition and his list by daughter, who had heard about it at school. Cice passed the story on to some bosses at the airline, who decided they wanted to help also. Premature: Ben was born so early that doctors didn't believe he would make it. He pushed through, however his sight has been slowly worsening as he has gotten older . Alaska Airlines then gave Ben, his parents and five siblings free return tickets to Fairbanks, Alaska, to see the Northern Lights, The News-Miner reported. And so on Thursday, the Pierce family touched down and checked into the Chena Hot Springs Resort. At midnight they were woken up by a guide and taken up a trail to the Northern Lights vantage point. Despite his fading vision, which sometimes him to use a magnifying glass to read, Ben was able to make out the show that was happening above him. 'It's really beautiful and pretty,' Ben told KTUU, gazing up at the lights. Happy: Among the other things on Ben's 'bucket list' are the Eiffel Tower, which his family hopes to visit sometime next, as well as the Pyramids in Egypt and the beaches of Los Angeles . 'It's like water colors going across the sky.' The Pierce family already have another trip book. They will soon go to Turner Falls, Oklahoma, to see Native American dancing, and plan to visit London and Paris next year, KTUU reported.

    "document": "By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 9:19 AM on 28th September 2011 . Raoul Moat died on 10 July 2010, aged 37, after a six-hour stand-off with police . Firearms officers who shot crazed gunman Raoul Moat with an untried, untested and unapproved Taser were yesterday cleared of any wrong-doing. Moat, 37, deliberately pulled the trigger of his sawn-off shotgun at the end of a tense six-hour stand-off with police last July after one of the Taser rounds struck his arm, an inquest jury found. The gunman, who had been on the run for seven days, had been cornered by firearms officers on the banks of the River Coquet in Rothbury, Northumberland. But the jury returned a suicide verdict yesterday, concluding there was no evidence to suggest the 500-volt Taser round which hit his arm caused him to inadvertently pull the trigger. Although Moat momentarily rocked backwards after being hit with the Taser – prompting him to cry out in pain – he instantly resumed his position, pressed the gun back to his temple and defiantly pulled the trigger. John Beggs QC, representing Northumbria Police during the £1million, three-week inquest, said he hoped the jury’s findings would finally ‘lay to rest’ the ‘ill-informed’ criticism that had previously emerged over the use of the Taser. Meanwhile an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission cleared the officers of misconduct. But the watchdog noted that they had not received any proper training before being handed the weapon. Cleared of wrongdoing: Police during their confrontation with fugitive Raoul Moat . Bystanders and children take photographs at West Cemetery and Crematorium in Newcastle, after the funeral of Raoul Moat . And questions will remain over the deployment of a weapon which has now been withdrawn from use by the Home Office. It was the first, and last, time the Extended Range Electronic Projectile Taser has ever been used in the UK, the inquest heard. Dubbed the ‘super Taser’, the XREP has a range five times longer than the conventional version and delivers a shock lasting 20 seconds, four times longer than the those currently in use. 1 Moat warned his girlfriend, Samantha . Stobbart, he would 'go crazy' after she split up with him . 2 Police found a noose . and six suicide notes in his Fenham home in Newcastle, when it was raided . 3 He told police negotiators he got so hungry he ate dead mice while living rough around Rothbury, Northumberland . 4 At the climax of the stand-off with police, Moat moved his sawn-off . shotgun from under his chin to his right temple, causing police to . believe he was about to kill himself . 5 The XRep Taser round . which hit him on the arm probably only caused a small electrical . discharge, if it did at all, and it did not penetrate his skin . 6 Being shot by a Taser did not cause him to accidentally pull the . trigger of his sawn-off shotgun, according to an expert on the effects . of electrical pulses on the nervous system . 7 Witnesses said there was a gap of up to two seconds between Moat being hit by the Taser and him pulling the trigger8 The XRep Taser shotgun cartridges fired from X12 shotguns are . 'conceptually' sound but in tests failed to work 'more often than not', . according to the Home Office . 9 Moat's heart was still beating when he arrived at Newcastle General Hospital, despite a brain injury that was non-survivable . 10 A 1cm ball bearing, believed to be the bullet which killed Moat, fell . on to the hospital floor after medics stopped operating - it had probably lodged in the hood of his top . Last night Moat’s half-brother Angus, 41, said he still believed using it was a ‘mistake’. He also criticised the way the inquest was set up. ‘A coroner’s inquest is intended to be non-adversarial, however at times it has felt like this inquest has been a three against one contest,’ he said. ‘Barristers representing Northumbria Police, ProTec [which supplied the Taser] and individual West Yorkshire officers were all pushing in one direction to justify police tactics and strategy. ‘The only opposition was legal representation for my family.’ Moat, who had been released from prison just 48 hours before his shooting rampage in July last year, critically wounded his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, 23, and killed her new lover, 29-year-old Christopher Brown. He also blinded PC David Rathband, 43, who was blasted twice as he sat defenceless in his traffic car at a roundabout. After Moat was cornered on July 9, negotiators attempted to persuade him to give himself up, but in the early hours of the following day he made a ‘deliberate’ movement with the gun, the inquest was told. It was then that two firearms officers from West Yorkshire Police – working as part of an operation led by Northumbria Police – fired a round from the controversial XREP Taser, which had not been approved by the Home Office. The inquest jury of five women and five men concluded the use of the XREP was ‘appropriate’. The jury said that after Moat was struck: ‘The gun momentarily moved away from his head. ‘Mr Moat corrected himself to his original position and repositioned the gun to his temple. Mr Moat then discharged the gun and shot himself.’ Meanwhile the IPCC report concluded that there was no evidence officers were guilty of misconduct. Last night Northumbria Police Chief Constable Sue Sim said: ‘Our use of the XREP shot gun Taser was carefully considered. The evidence was clear. There were simply no other options available to us to stop Moat from taking his own life.’",

    "document": "(CNN) -- We're just going to put it out there: Behind closed doors, whites talk differently about blacks. At least that's what two sociologists found after conducting a study of college students across the country. One of the researchers, Joe Feagin, said that's why it comes as no surprise to him that a powerful politician such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would talk about Barack Obama's skin color and use the term \"Negro dialect\" in what he considered a private conversation. Speaking not of Reid but of his conclusions drawn from his research, Feagin said, \"Most whites have sharply reduced the blatantly racist stuff they do in public, while they still do huge amounts in private.\" \"It's just social correctness in the front stage. The scale of this is gigantic on the backstage, which is why the notion of a post-racial America is laughable,\" said Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University. \"And I think most whites know it because they've been to Thanksgiving dinner with Uncle Jim and have heard the n-word jokes.\" Feagin and Leslie Picca of the University of Dayton compiled their research in a book called \"Two-Faced Racism\" published in 2007. They surveyed 626 white students at 28 colleges and universities across the country. They asked the students to keep diaries and record any racial events they came across during the course of a day. The students recorded 9,000 accounts, of which 7,500 were \"blatantly racist\" events ranging from private jokes and conversations to violent incidents, Feagin said. About 100 accounts stood up against racism, he said. The majority of racial events were directed at African-Americans, but Latinos and Asians also came under attack. Feagin and Picca also surveyed African-American students, but that research is still being compiled. \"In these 7,500 blatant accounts, most of them are accounts of what we call backstage racism -- that is they're doing these performances and skits with friends and relatives,\" Feagin said. Does it surprise him that someone with such political clout as Reid would use a term such as \"Negro dialect\"? \"No,\" Feagin said, \"not after looking at our student diaries.\" He said Reid \"felt safe making\" the comment about Obama because he was in a private setting. \"It's a great teaching moment,\" Feagin said. \"It shows the difference between the front stage and the backstage. He thought he was saying that in the backstage, and now it's been brought out in the public for all to see and discuss.\" The controversy is centered on remarks published in the book \"Game Change\" by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. The book cites Reid as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could succeed as a black candidate partly because of his \"light-skinned\" appearance and speaking patterns \"with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\" Reid, D-Nevada, apologized to the president after excerpts from the book were released, and Obama said he considered the issue closed. Your take: iReporters sound off on the issue . \"This is a good man who's always been on the right side of history,\" Obama said Monday in a sit-down interview with CNN political contributor Roland Martin. \"For him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me, and for people to try to make hay out of that, makes absolutely no sense.\" Reid has received the support of the Congressional Black Caucus. On Monday, he said numerous prominent African-American officials, including NAACP Chairman Julian Bond and Attorney General Eric Holder, called to offer their support. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, has called for Reid to give up his leadership post after the \"embarrassing and racially insensitive\" remarks. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele also called for Reid to step down. Duke University political science professor Kerry Haynie said he doesn't dispute that attitudes toward race may be viewed differently in private than in public. But he said he doesn't feel that came into play with Reid's remarks. \"Many of us who work in areas of race and politics asked these same kinds of questions, about whether Obama is different for whites than other black politicians,\" Haynie said. \"I don't think Sen. Reid was expressing sentiments he would not have expressed publicly.\" Boyce Watkins, an associate professor at Syracuse University, said the country shouldn't let this moment pass. \"The takeaway is that there is a teachable moment, but we can't allow politicians to do all the teaching,\" Watkins told CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"If you watched President Obama's interview with Roland Martin, the conversation tends to be let's sweep this under the rug and throw the baby out with the bath water and move on. \"But the truth is that they are trying to get health care passed, and that's good, I respect that, but I want to have the conversation on race.\" Added Dawn Turner Trice, a columnist and blogger with the Chicago Tribune: \"For me, it's that we have to continue to talk about this. We can't only talk about it when we have these national flare-ups. This takes time and nuanced conversations. ... \"The country is changing. In a couple decades, we will have a country with a very different racial makeup. And we will have to have these conversations, and it's to our peril if we don't.\" Feagin, the sociologist, said he agrees. He said Democrats and Obama should come forward to talk openly about the national climate on race. \"We can't keep ducking this racism stuff,\" he said. CNN's Matt Cherry contributed to this report.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- On a winter evening in early 1940, Hattie McDaniel became the first black performer to win an Oscar, a best supporting actress honor for her performance as Mammy, the servant in \"Gone With the Wind.\" Will Smith has overcome racial boundaries but can do more, says an expert in race-based casting. She accepted her award at the Academy Awards ceremony at the Coconut Grove, a nightclub in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel, where she was seated in the segregated section at the rear of the room. Though her win was played as a sign of progress for black actors in America -- \"Not only was she the first of her race to receive an Award, but she was also the first Negro ever to sit at an Academy banquet,\" said Daily Variety, according to Mason Wiley and Damien Bona's indispensable \"Inside Oscar\" -- her role was poorly received by much of the black community. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People claimed that the part was stereotypical and degrading. \"I think [the NAACP] were correct,\" said Jill Watts, author of \"Hattie McDaniel: Black Ambition, White Hollywood.\" But, Watts added, \"McDaniel knew that 'If I reject these maid roles, [black people] won't be on the screen.' And her point was, 'we need a presence within the industry.' \" Nearly 70 years after McDaniel's win, black performers have certainly come far. Actors like Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington and Halle Berry have broken boundaries in making their mark on the film industry. But black actors have been few and far between at the Oscars. In its 80-year history, the Academy has awarded 11 black actors with trophies, six of whom won in this decade. This year, two black actors are nominated for Academy Awards: Viola Davis for her role in \"Doubt\" and Taraji P. Henson for her part in \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\" Watch Viola Davis talk about the Oscars » . Tom O'Neil, entertainment reporter for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com and founder of GoldDerby.com, a Web site dedicated to predicting and analyzing award show wins, said the Academy finally began making an effort to recognize black actors after Halle Berry and Denzel Washington won Oscars in 2002. \"The Oscars were notoriously stingy to black actors,\" O'Neil said. \"It was that year that it became such a huge issue in the media and Hollywood really woke up to this issue.\" O'Neil claims that Hollywood has improved in its recognition of black actors, but the Academy's failure to nominate 2006's \"Dreamgirls\" for best picture, for example, is a sign that Oscar voters simply don't understand such films culturally. \"I don't believe that there's an element of racism. It's an inability to relate to the drama being portrayed,\" O'Neil said. \"The largely white Academy just didn't get ['Dreamgirls']. They weren't emotionally engaged in the story.\" Although awarding Oscars to 11 black actors is \"stingy,\" O'Neil said, \"you have to compare that to the number of quality films that gave good roles to actors.\" That's the problem, said Russell Robinson, a professor of law at the University of California - Los Angeles, who wrote a 2006 report about unfair race-based casting in Hollywood. \"It's an industry norm that the assumption is that roles go to white actors,\" Robinson said. \"They use people of color to flesh out the film and exemplify racial stereotypes.\" Robinson's report, \"Hollywood's Race/Ethnicity And Gender-Based Casting: Prospects For A Title VII Lawsuit,\" found that the majority of roles that do not specify a race or ethnicity are played by white actors, which tends to limit black actors to stereotypical roles. \"I think what bothers a lot of African-Americans is that we see the same images time and time again. ... We'd like to see the full range of complexities that we see in our communities,\" Robinson said. In the past, black actors didn't have much of choice when it came to playing stereotypical parts, said John Forbes, executive director of the Black Hollywood Education and Resource Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting films featuring black actors. \"People had to do what they had to do in those days on and off the screen to survive,\" he said. In the early 1900s, that often meant playing caricature roles like that of Stepin Fetchit, a foolish and weak character created and played by Lincoln Perry, who eventually became the first black millionaire actor. With the arrival of Poitier to the film industry in the 1950s, Hollywood seemed to change its perspective of black actors. iReport.com: Who will win at the Oscars? \"Poitier was able to create a character that was always strong. The black male image that he portrayed on the screen was something that everyone was proud of,\" Forbes said. More recently, actors like Will Smith have been successful in overcoming racial boundaries because they're profitable, Robinson said. But with their success also comes responsibility. As the biggest box office star in the world, Smith, Robinson believes, is obligated to push Hollywood to make changes. With Smith's 2005 film \"Hitch,\" \"the studio would not cast a black woman as Will Smith's love interest in the film because they didn't want the film to be a 'black film,' \" Robinson said. \"I would hope that Will challenged that decision. ... I would hope that Will would try to get black actors hired.\" Robinson added, \"the question is, 'How can you use that power to help other people?' \"",

    "document": "By . Lord Saatchi . Tomorrow is only the beginning. At 3pm in the House of Lords I will introduce the Medical Innovation Bill 2012. It will take 30 seconds, no more, but it will set in motion an important process. For this is truly a matter of life and death. The aim, in practical terms, is to change the way we treat patients, many of them terminally ill. The Bill's ultimate goal is to help find a cure for cancer. I confess to a personal interest. On December 17, 2009, my wife, the novelist Josephine Hart, was diagnosed with primary peritoneal cancer. It was at the hospital, at 5.32pm, that Josephine was told the news. Legacy: Lord Saatchi with his wife Josephine Hart before she died last year from cancer . She uttered three words. Malignant. Advanced. Inoperable. We didn't know then that it was terminal. There is always hope. Until there isn't. And, as we discovered, there is precious little cause for optimism in the cancer ward. It is a place of fear and uncertainty and medieval treatments that are degrading and ineffective. I have witnessed scenes there that would not be permitted in a Hollywood horror movie. Josephine died on June 2, 2011. Since then I have felt a gnawing, numbing, grief. I always will. Sot say this Bill with Josephine or my love of Josephine would be ridiculous. I wouldn't know about any of this if it weren't for her and what happened. But let me make clear: there is no real connection. This Bill stands alone. I want to make a valid, worthwhile contribution, to put all that I have learnt to good use, and I realise that's not necessarily helped by being the relative of the deceased. It's worth remembering the people who have helped with the drafting of this Bill have no connection at all. My team has spent a year researching this and we've consulted some of the top medical minds in the country. We also have their backing. The Bill itself has been drafted by one of the top parliamentary counsels, the person who is managing the legislative process is the former Clerk of the House of Lords. Their motive is not bereavement, it is to encourage people to find a cure for cancer. That's exactly how I feel. I am a rational person confronted with a conundrum. Which is, how is it possible that there's been so much technological advance in so many spheres but not in cancer? Certainly not in the type of women's cancers that Josephine suffered. And I've found one explanation. It is this. In English law there is only one test in cases of medical negligence. If a doctor is accused of failing to provide the proper care, a panel of expert witnesses is called to determine whether they would have acted in the same way. It stands to reason therefore that you are more likely to be found guilty of medical negligence if you depart from standard procedure. Your livelihood and reputation are at risk if you deviate from the status quo. This, the, is a key barrier to progress. Innovation is deviation by definition. This Bill will change the law in a very specific way by setting out a procedure that doctors can follow if they want to try a new and different treatment. According to Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive at The Institute of Cancer Research, thanks to research into the cancer genome we are now on the brink of being able to provide much less toxic therapies. Doctors know how to use them in a small subsection of a few cancers such as blood and lung cancers but they should be given more freedom to utilise them in an experimental setting. This Bill sets out the framework for that. How is it that we are still relying on chemotherapy, radiotherapy and invasive surgery when none of them guarantee a certain outcome? Worse, they often do more harm than good. Most people think the terrible thing about cancer treatment is the hair loss. Hair loss, particularly for a woman, is a terrible thing, but the side effects of the drugs are much more horrific than that. They create the same symptoms as the disease - nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and fatigue. Change: Tory peer Lord Saatchi wants to amend the law to make it easier for doctors to try new treatments for cancer . A further effect of the drugs is to damage the immune system, which opens a path to fatal infection. So a person is as likely to die from the treatment as from the cancer itself. With this Bill, doctors may try new methods, confident that they have a legal framework to work within. I realise there will be objections. Nobody's going to change the law without objections. Firstly, I expect the Government will say it's otiose, a term much used in Parliament, which means unnecessary. In other words this Bill will bring no benefit, they are already doing a marvellous job, tremendous new funds are being given to cancer research and people are working day and night on a cure. I don't think that's a serious objection because I don't think anyone who has any experience of cancer would agree that everything's going terribly well at all. The second objection is much more important, and it's that this Bill is dangerous. It's a license for recklessness and will allow quacks and snake oil merchants to practise experiments on patients and put lives at risk. In fact, the opposite is true. A correct process, set out in law, will deter illogical or unreasonable departure from standard practice. A great deal of our research has focused on finding that balance between innovation and recklessness. And we need that innovation. While the medical profession has made great inroads in some diseases, in others, such as pancreatic or ovarian cancer, there has been very little advance in rates of survival. According to the experts, the cure for cancer, like the discovery of penicillin or insulin, will come from a man or a woman who has an idea. And it is going to happen one day. But if it is to work they need to test that idea and prove that it's true. This Bill is going to help encourage that person. So there is my motivation. True, my personal sorrow knows no bounds. Conventional thinking tells us to 'move on' after death. I disagree. That would be a monstrous act of betrayal. Josephine is me, I am her, we are one. Death cannot change that. My wife said poetry saved her life. Its essential truths have rescued me too. In a poem by Robert Frost, Out, Out, a boy's arm is cut off in the sawmill. As he bleeds to death his workmates, 'since they were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.' Josephine said that was the most brutal line in all of English literature. I will not be the one to turn away. If this Bil can help even one person, a mother, daughter, father, son, I will be happy. But ultimately, one day, I hope it will help find a cure. It will be a fitting legacy.",

The 400-year-old chapel in which the Bronte sisters were baptised has been desecrated by stone thieves. Crowbar-wielding looters ripped up two 200-year-old burial slabs from the graveyard, wrenched stones from the chapel walls, and tore up part of the nearby Bronte Way footpath. It is feared that they will have thrown away the irreplaceable marked gravestones when they realised they were among their haul of valuable York stone. Desecrated: Bare earth is exposed where thieves tore up a Yorkshire stone burial slab outside by the old bell chapel in Thornton, West Yorkshire . Volunteers have worked for 12 years to restore the cemetery and Grade Two-listed 'Bronte Bell Chapel', next to St James' Parish Church in the village of Thornton, near Bradford, West Yorkshire. Although the Brontes are more closely associated with the Parsonage a few miles away in Haworth they were actually born in Thornton where their clergyman father had his living from 1815 to 1820. All three of the literary sisters and their brother Branwell were baptised in the chapel, where their father Patrick Bronte preached his first sermon about the Duke of Wellington’s 1815 victory over Napoleon at Waterloo. Organised: It would have taken four men to carry away the two 200-year-old burial slabs . Irreplaceable: The slabs bore inscriptions that were much more detailed than those on the headstones themselves . Patrick once described his years . in Thornton as 'the happiest in his life', before the family was torn . apart by the premature deaths of its literary prodigies. On Saturday, members of the action group set up to restore the site came along to tend the graveyard - and discovered thousands of pounds of damage. Thieves had removed two horizontal grave . slabs measuring six foot long by three foot wide and four inches thick - . which would take four men to lift. Greedy: The looters also took pieces of stone from fifteen other graves, and paving slabs from the Bronte Way, a footpath linking Bronte landmarks across Yorkshire . Search: There are concerns that the thieves will have dumped the slabs once they realise their significance . They had also taken slabs from the Bronte Way, a footpath linking points of interest across the moorland that inspired Wuthering Heights. One of the graves marked the final resting place of tragic John and Mary Pickles and the five children who predeceased them in the 1820s. The other stone covered the plot of Hannah and James Abbott and their 28-year-old daughter Mary who were all dead by 1828. The thieves did not touch the actual headstones, but the inscriptions on the slabs were more extensive. Pieces of York stone had also been removed from the top of 15 other graves. Coping stones had been ripped from the chapel itself and much of the churchyard footpath torn up. Restored: Local volunteers had been working hard to restore the 'Bronte' bell chapel (pictured), of St James Church in Thornton . Historic: The Bronte children were baptised in the chapel (pictured as it was), where their father Patrick was clergyman . Yesterday the attack was roundly condemned by the local people who had worked tirelessly to restore the site, West Yorkshire Police, and civic leaders. Churchwarden Steven Stanworth, the mastermind of the chapel restoration, was sickened. 'We are proud of our achievements in making Bronte Bell Chapel and surrounding graveyard a place where people can now visit to enjoy its history, beauty and nature. Literary genius: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (left) and Wuthering Heights by Emily (right) are two of the greatest works of nineteenth-century English literature . 'It is a historic site and it has been desecrated. This was a despicable and awful crime. Thousands of pounds of stone have been stolen and the graves are irreplaceable. 'The thieves probably dumped them in a hedge or threw them over a wall once they realised there were inscriptions which made them identifiable. 'The action group of nine volunteers have put a lot of hard work in and are devastated. Family: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte (left) is still popular today. Patrick Bronte (right) was parson in Thornton between 1815 and 1820 . 'It is absolutely disgraceful and disgusting. The morons who did this must be sick and have no respect for life, death or social history.' 'We were celebrating 400 years of its history this year and it has taken the edge off it.' The graveyard was the final resting place of many local worthies before the last plot was filled in 1965. The Brontes were one of the most important families in English literary history. Sisters . Charlotte, Emily and Anne all began to write at an early age at their . home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. Their stories started as a game based . around brother Branwell's toy soldiers. Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights are regarded as classics of English literature. Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall remains a huge bestseller. Emily . and Anne both died of tuberculosis in 1848-9 aged 30 and 29 . respectively. Branwell and Charlotte were also killed by the disease. Their . deaths added to the heartbreak of clergyman father Patrick Bronte, who . had already lost two younger children to tuberculosis and his wife to . cancer. The gates are left unlocked to allow their ancestors to pay their respects and for families to enjoy the peace and quiet. The churchwarden added: 'What has happened has been devastating. The two graves taken are over 200 years old and were irreplaceable. It’s totally sad. 'Local stonemasons have been contacted but they do not hold out much hope of getting them back.' Police patrols were stepped up around St James' Church on Thornton Road after the damage was discovered. Detective Inspector Mark Long said: 'This is quite clearly a despicable act which will cause great offence in the local community. 'Police are aware of the theft of Yorkshire stone and these gravestones from the church and have been in contact with officials there. 'Unfortunately, there are no positive lines of inquiry at this time despite investigations. 'So we appeal to anyone who has information and furthermore, to any local stonemasons who are offered what are clearly gravestones to contact us.' Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, Bradford Council’s portfolio holder for tourism, described the sacrilege as 'sickening'. She added: 'The Old Bell Chapel has a strong significance to the Bronte story, and is a major tourist draw for the Bradford district. People who commit these crimes throw away hundreds of years of history.'",

The 35 Chinese stamps, which were originally bought by an English missionary in Shanghai in 1882, were recently uncovered in an old cigar box in the attic of a property in the Cotswolds. They were sent to an auction in Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire, where they were given an estimated value of between £800 and £1,000. However, they were snapped up for an astonishing £79,000 by international stamp dealer Allan Grant, who received a tip-off that the stamps could be worth a fortune. He now plans to sell them overseas for a whopping £250,000. The 35 rare Chinese stamps, which were originally bought by an English missionary in Shanghai in 1882, were recently discovered in an old cigar box in the attic of a property in the Cotswolds and sold at auction . Winning bidder Allan Grant snapped up the stamps, which had an original estimated value of up to £1000. Mr Grant (pictured) paid £79,000 for the stamps after being tipped-off and now wants to sell them for £250,000 . Three other bidders for Lot 94 - 'A Cigar Box of Early Chinese Stamps' – knew the uncut stamps were valuable, and bidding rose rapidly in thousands, to the amazement of locals at the auction, where most items fetch under £100. Mr Grant, owner of philatelic firm Rushstamps, which is based in Lyndhurst in Hampshire's New Forest National Park, now plans to sell the rare stamps in Hong Kong and believes they will fetch at least £250,000. The lot is particularly valuable because within the collection is an uncut sheet of nineteen ultra-rare 'candarin' stamps, which had been kept by the English missionary for 'day to day postage use'. The rather insignificant-looking unused yellow stamps, printed on very thin paper, were bought in Shanghai in 1882 and feature a dragon design. They are known in the stamp world as '5 candarin ochres'. Auctioneer Nicholas Granger, owner of British Bespoke Auctions, said the original owner of the Chinese stamps wishes to remain anonymous but says the seller was 'stunned but delighted' by the huge amount he received for them.

The find is being described by experts as 'incredible and unparalleled'. Winning bidder Mr Grant said the demand for early Chinese stamps now is 'unprecedented'. He added: 'Finding unused examples in such superb condition, still on a sheet, is incredibly rare. 'Eventually it was between myself and one other bidder.

American stamp dealer Larry Gibson, co-chairman of Connecticut-based Daniel Kelleher Auctions, flew to England today to collect the stamp sheet from Mr Grant. The pair are going into partnership to sell the stamps in Hong Kong, because they believe the collection will fetch a far higher sum overseas. Mr Gibson said: 'I've had a long career specialising in Chinese stamps. And this is by far the biggest and most unparalleled find of my life. 'It is absolutely amazing. I have never known anything like it. I think bidding will easily be in excess of £250,000. 'They will create a sensation in China, with millionaires vying with each other to buy their culture back.

    "document": "Cupertino, California (CNN) -- Tim Cook, Apple's newly appointed CEO, did not introduce a single product on Tuesday. At Cook's first news conference since officially taking over for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, his team of executives announced a new iPhone, an application for sending greeting cards, and a location-based social network called Find My Friends. But Cook himself did not announce a single thing. To use artistic metaphors, perhaps that's indicative of how Cook sees his role as Apple leader -- not as a sculptor but as an orchestra conductor. Jobs is renowned for his ability to mold the shape of products during their development and for his involvement in seemingly trivial details of the business. He does not hesitate to tell his employees or powerful partners outside the company when he thinks they are wrong and need to rethink products. And, as even those who have been on the receiving end admit, he's usually right. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates once said of Jobs, \"I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste.\" Cook, who filled in for Jobs when he had taken medical leaves in past years, opened and closed Tuesday's iPhone 4S presentation alone, a role typically reserved for Jobs. The event was an important exam for Cook, and analysts say he passed. \"I think Tim Cook did fine today,\" said John Jackson, an analyst at Boston-based market research firm CCS Insight, who attended the keynote. \"The bench picks up where Steve left off.\" At Apple's developers conference in June, when Jobs was on medical leave and Cook was filling in as interim CEO, Jobs was the first to take the stage. At that event, he unveiled the ambitious iCloud Internet service and then concluded the keynote. On Tuesday, however, Eddy Cue, who was Cook's first top-level executive appointment since becoming chief, handled the iCloud segment. Cook, Apple's longtime operating chief before rising to CEO, has had limited stage experience. He appeared in New York earlier this year for a Verizon Wireless news conference where the U.S. cellular giant announced that it would start carrying the iPhone. Tuesday was Cook's first test on his home turf. Although some observers on Twitter griped during the event about a lack of eye-popping news, Cook appeared comfortable and confident. He recited his lines flawlessly, and cracked jokes about iPads making planes more fuel-efficient, which elicited hearty laughs. (However, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing exec, drew the most laughs when describing the improved camera on the iPhone 4S and how hard it was to get a squirrel to stand still for a photo shoot.) Apple's fall announcements are typically held at a convention center in San Francisco and focus heavily on new iPods, but this one took place in a small auditorium on Apple's campus here, which limited the size of the crowd. \"It's sort of like inviting you into our home,\" Cook said to a crowd of reporters, analysts and executives. \"Just 10 years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music.\" In between discussing Apple Store openings in China and explaining sales and market share data, Cook made several comments that seemed humble and personal. \"I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for 14 years and am very excited about this new role,\" he said at the outset. And he closed with, \"I am so incredibly proud of this company.\" The amount of preparation and rehearsal that went into Cook's onstage arrangement was evident, said Gartner analyst Michael King, who did not attend the event but followed along from Washington. \"I actually thought it was a little more crisp than a Jobs presentation,\" he said. \"Less story time, more presentation.

    "document": "GAZA CITY (CNN) -- About 150 pro-Fatah Palestinians seeking refuge from a Hamas crackdown in eastern Gaza City were allowed into Israel on Saturday, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN. Fatah members are led handcuffed and blindfolded through a Gaza City checkpoint into Israel on Saturday. They were let in at the request of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas took control of a neighborhood in eastern Gaza City on Saturday. The Palestinians entered through a security checkpoint in Nahal Oz in the Gaza's northern region Saturday afternoon, the spokesman said. \"They were asking to enter the state of Israel after being threatened by Hamas gunmen,\" the spokesman said. The spokesman said the Palestinians, some of whom were wounded, were allowed to cross the border after they disarmed. He also said they would be asked about the events leading them to seek refuge in Israel. Those who suffered injuries were taken to a facility to receive medical treatment. It was a rare act that could be interpreted as a sign of Israel's support of the Fatah party, which is led by Abbas. \"It was a sort of humane gesture,\" the IDF spokesman said. Hamas forces took control of the al-Shojaeya neighborhood in eastern Gaza City late Saturday, ending several hours of deadly fighting. The Hamas forces were battling a family suspected of harboring Fatah members wanted in last week's Gaza beach bombing. Hamas police surrounded the clan, and a battle began with rocket-propelled grenades, rockets and rifles, sources said. The violence in the large neighborhood left four people dead, including two police officers, and wounded at least 60 others. Watch a report on the violence » . The IDF confirmed that some of the Palestinians who entered Israel on Saturday were members of the clan. Hamas Interior Minister Said Salam said in a news conference that bomb-making materials were found. He asked why so many people would have fled to Israel if they weren't guilty. Hamas forces began raiding houses in the 15-block neighborhood after the fighting died down, arresting at least 12 men Saturday night. Earlier, the Hilles clan, a family known to support Fatah, refused Hamas police demands to hand over 20 activists suspected in the bomb attack, sources said. Hamas security forces in Gaza had already detained hundreds of people affiliated with Fatah since five Hamas militants and a child died in the July 25 beach bombing. Fatah sources say about 450 were apprehended. Among the dead in the beach attack was Amar Musubah, a Hamas military commander, who has been the target of Israeli military assassination attempts. Fatah denied responsibility for the attack. Hamas sources said Saturday the group will release 10 Fatah members arrested earlier in Gaza. In addition, Hamas released Fatah spokesman Ibrahim Abu-Naja. Hamas also shut down a radio station, accusing it of airing pro-Fatah broadcasts. The two Palestinian factions have been bitterly divided since Hamas drove Abbas' security forces from Gaza last year. Gaza tunnel collapse kills 5, hurts 16 . Meanwhile, early Saturday, a tunnel used to smuggle goods into Gaza from Egypt collapsed, killing at least five people and injuring 16, Palestinian sources said. The supply tunnel, which collapsed near Rafah, was one of many dug along the Gaza-Egypt border in the past year, since Israel closed border crossings. The move followed Hamas' takeover of the territory. The tunnel operations have grown into a big business. The tunnels are sometimes built too close to each other for safety. Journalist Talal Abu-Rahmi in Gaza contributed to this report.",

She was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her. Bateman, of Bideford, Devon, admitted causing actual bodily harm to Aaron McMahon and assault by beating of Richard Ball. Her sentence was adjourned for reports by Judge Erik Salomonsen. The Judge told her she would not face an immediate jail sentence. He said: 'I have seen the letter from her doctor and the psychological report and it seems to me a case where she needs to be treated in the community to ensure there is no further offending.' The judge made his ruling after being told that CCTV from the club showed the incident in which the first victim suffered a small graze and bruising to his face after she leaned over and bit him on the cheek. The second was grabbed by the shirt in a second incident shortly afterwards. Kate Bateman was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her .

'She reacted in a hyper vigilant way to what she perceived as threats from males. When she was shown the CCTV she became very anxious and had a panic attack. 'She reacted very differently from someone who was not suffering from her condition. She has been suffering for some time, having been diagnosed in 2007.' Miss Heaton said the attacks in August last year coincided with the start of a new treatment regime which is proving successful.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Two years ago next week, Superstorm Sandy barreled through parts of the United States, causing $65 billion worth of damage to communities up and down the Eastern seaboard. Sandy, which brought extensive flooding to New York and Atlantic City, was described by many as a once in a generation storm. But in the coming years, thanks to global warming, it won't take superstorms like Sandy to bring regular and potentially dangerous flooding to parts of the United States. Tidal flooding used to be a relatively rare occurrence along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, generally happening only occasionally at high tide or king tide, when the sun and the moon are aligned. But based on what scientists already know about climate change, it is clear that sea levels are going to rise over the next few decades. Coastal flooding is expected to occur even more often and cause more disruption. This will redefine how and where coastal residents live, work, and go about their daily routines. High tides are having a greater impact now for two reasons. First, our coasts are more heavily developed, so higher tides affect more people and infrastructure. Second, these tides are now occurring along with elevated -- and rising -- sea levels. Global sea levels rose approximately 8 inches from 1880 to 2009 as global warming hastened land-based ice melt, and seawater expanded as it absorbed heat from a warming atmosphere. Sea level rise worldwide is now accelerating, and at an especially fast rate along parts of the East Coast. This reality is captured in a report we co-authored earlier this month, analyzing how often flooding occurs at 52 sites along the Eastern seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico and estimating the frequency and extent of flooding over the next 15 and 30 years. We found that many East Coast communities now experience dozens of tidal floods every year. In some places, there has been a fourfold increase in the number of days per year with tidal flooding since 1970. When tidal floods occur, water can cover roads for hours, making passage risky or even impossible, trapping residents in their homes. Sometimes this is just a short-lived nuisance, requiring traffic detours. But sometimes floods can compromise evacuation routes -- a particular problem when public safety and commerce in some coastal communities, such as those that dot the Outer Banks in North Carolina, depend on just one or two access routes. So what can we do? In the short term, municipalities, counties and states have to clear flooded coastal roads and repair damage from erosion and overwash. But over the long term, \"in many cases, they are going to have to raise the roads on their existing path,\" according to Steve Miller at the Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in New Hampshire. \"Money is a big question.\" Retail stores, restaurants and public infrastructure clustered in low-lying waterfront areas are also threatened by tidal flooding. South Florida has been particularly hard-hit. Tidal flooding \"has really affected our business,\" noted Bobby Thakore, owner of the Taste Bakery CafÃ© on Alton Road in Miami Beach and one of the many people we spoke with when compiling our report. \"We are down 15 percent on revenue during flooding, and in the past year construction [to address flooding] mixed with the flooding and has made our revenue loss worse.\" Using a midrange estimate for future sea level rise, we found that more than half of the 52 communities we analyzed can expect to average more than two dozen tidal floods per year by 2030. The rise in the frequency of tidal flooding represents an extremely steep increase for some, and two-thirds could experience at least three times more high-tide floods every year. We expect the Mid-Atlantic coast to see some of the biggest increases in flood frequency. Because many communities are already coping with tidal floods, a tripling in their frequency would mean they could occur more than four times a month by 2030. Annapolis, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., for example, can expect to average more than 150 tidal floods a year, and several New Jersey locations could suffer 80 tidal floods or more annually. By 2045, many coastal communities likely will experience a sea level rise of about a foot. As that occurs, a third of the 52 locations in our analysis would begin to average more than 180 tidal floods a year. And nine locations, including Atlantic City and Cape May in New Jersey, can expect tidal floods 240 times or more per year. Without sensible preparation, daily life in low-lying areas along the East and Gulf coasts will become at best risky and at worst dangerous. Coastal communities -- and state and federal agencies -- have to start planning today to cope with unprecedented tidal flooding and take precautions to limit longer-term damage. Communities need to flood-proof homes, neighborhoods and sewer and stormwater infrastructure and limit new development in flood-prone areas. Federal and state governments, meanwhile, need to monitor sea level rise and flooding, provide funding and other resources for local resilience-building efforts, reform flood insurance programs, and -- most importantly -- address the root of the problem. Sadly, the reality is that the near-term increase in sea level and tidal flooding may be unavoidable. But if states and the federal governments take concerted action to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, then we can at least avoid the worst consequences of global warming.",

A new malaria vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 100 million cases of the disease each year and save 200,000 lives, British experts have said. Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the RTS,S malaria vaccine could have an ‘enormous’ public health impact, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Results released today by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) showed the jab continued to protect young children and babies from malaria for up to 18 months after vaccination. A new malaria vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 100 million cases of the disease each year and save 200,000 lives, British experts have said . The firm now plans to submit an application to European regulators with the hope of getting the vaccine approved - meaning its introduction could be less than two years away. Over 18 months, the RTS,S vaccine was shown to almost halve the number of malaria cases in children aged five to 17-months. The study of more than 15,000 babies and young children found the vaccine reduced, by around a quarter, malaria cases in babies aged six to 12-weeks at first vaccination. The youngsters received the jab in three separate doses one month apart. During follow-up, their immunity to malaria declined and a sample of the children were given a booster jab. Experts are now awaiting results of the booster to see if it offered extended protection. Professor Riley said the initial three doses had been shown to deliver between 30 per cent and 50 per cent protection. Results released today by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline showed the jab continued to protect young children and babies from malaria for up to 18 months after vaccination . ‘In public health terms, if you could vaccinate every child at risk of malaria you could reduce cases by a third to a half and you could reduce deaths by a third to a half,’ she said. ‘It would have an enormous impact in terms of public health.’ Professor Riley said 200,000 lives a year could be saved worldwide if every at risk child was vaccinated. And some 100 million cases a year worldwide could be prevented, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. While it is too early to talk about . eradicating the disease entirely, Professor Riley said combining the . malaria vaccine with other measures such as spraying homes with . insecticides, using insecticide bed nets and improving drugs for . treatment would have a huge impact on the numbers affected. Over 18 months, the RTS,S vaccine was shown to almost halve the number of malaria cases in children aged five to 17-months (image shows the micro-organisms that cause malaria) The RTS,S vaccine works by triggering . the immune system to defend against the malaria parasite when it first . enters the bloodstream and/or when the parasite infects liver cells. It is designed to prevent the parasite from infecting, maturing and multiplying in the liver. Professor Riley said the jab prevented 90 per cent to 95 per cent of malaria parasites getting into the bloodstream. But the remaining 5 per cent to 10 per cent of parasites were still enough to make people sick, which is why the jab does not offer complete protection. Professor Sir Brian Greenwood, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is an investigator on the trial, said: ‘Results show that the malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 continues to protect vaccinated children during an 18 month follow-up period, preventing many cases of malaria. ‘Protection declined during the follow up period. However, one third of the children in the trial have now received a booster dose of vaccine. We will learn next year if this protects these children for a further period.’ Eleven research centres in seven African countries are conducting the trial, together with GSK and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), with grant funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to MVI. Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK, said: ‘We're very encouraged by these latest results, which show that RTS,S continued to provide meaningful protection over 18 months to babies and young children across different regions of Africa. ‘While we have seen some decline in vaccine efficacy over time, the sheer number of children affected by malaria means that the number of cases of the disease the vaccine can help prevent is impressive. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding for the vaccine trial which took place in seven African countries . ‘These data support our decision to . submit a regulatory application for the vaccine candidate which, if . successful, would bring us a step closer to having an additional tool to . fight this deadly disease. We are grateful to the scientists across . Africa and GSK and to our partners who have worked tirelessly for almost . 30 years to bring us to this point.’ Dr David Kaslow, vice president of product development at PATH, said: ‘Given the huge disease burden of malaria among African children, we cannot ignore what these latest results tell us about the potential for RTS,S to have a measurable and significant impact on the health of millions of young children in Africa. ‘While we want to be careful about not getting ahead of the data, this trial continues to show that a malaria vaccine could potentially bring an important additional benefit beyond that provided by the tools already in use.’ The results of the trial were published in Durban, South Africa. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has indicated a policy recommendation for the RTS,S vaccine could be possible as early as 2015 if it is approved by European regulators.",

Brittney Gallagher and Courtney Miller, both 21, were pronounced dead at the scene after their car spun across the road in the Florida panhandle. Their friends Diana Mitchell and Lauren Kane, both 22, are critically injured in hospital after the accident that happened on Saturday morning as they set off back to Ohio after a trip to Panama City Beach. Both Brittney Gallagher, 21, left, and Ohio State University classmate Courtney Miller, 21, right, died at the scene . All four were OSU students. Miss Gallagher was driving the 2000 Dodge at the time of the accident, which ripped the front off the car . All four women were students at Ohio State University and were riding in a four-door dodge driven by Miss Gallagher, according to the News Herald. Miss Gallagher, 21, was driving westbound on SR 20 in her 2000 Neon, and drifted into eastbound traffic.According to the Florida Highway Patrol crash report, she ‘aggressively’ veered back into the westbound lane.

    "document": "(CNN) -- Amid our vacations, fireworks and barbecues Wednesday, it's easy to forget that we are actually commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The most famous phrase from that document is one of our nation's founding values: \"All men are created equal.\" As it happens, this July Fourth week brings two significant victories for that value that are worth celebrating. Most Americans are probably not aware that since 2011, more than two dozen measures have passed that will make it more difficult for some eligible citizens to vote, denying them the opportunity to participate equally in our democracy. Too often, it appears that politicians are trying to manipulate voting laws to save their jobs and pick their voters, rather than allowing all voters to choose their politicians. The good news is that the public, the courts and some elected officials have fought these new restrictions in several states, including Ohio, Maine, Missouri and, just Tuesday, Michigan. Another view: Voter ID laws are common sense . To the surprise of many -- at the urging of good government and voting rights groups, several editorial pages and many of Michigan's citizens -- Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed a package of restrictive voting laws in that state. One of the bills would have restricted voter registration drives. Under that bill's proposed rules, the League of Women Voters of Michigan, which has conducted voter registration drives for decades, would need to attend mandatory, state-approved training sessions. But the law did not say how widely those trainings would be available. The law also would have required volunteers to sign an intimidating form threatening them with criminal prosecution for vaguely defined offenses. (In May, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle stopped a similar requirement in a Florida law, saying this can have \"no purpose other than to discourage voluntary participation in legitimate, indeed constitutionally protected, activities.\") Also this week, the state of Florida confirmed it will likely not resume its purge of the voter rolls, which gained national notoriety and could have kept thousands of eligible citizens from voting in November. Florida Gov. Rick Scott claimed the purge was necessary to get noncitizens off the registration rolls. Of course, if a state confirms that noncitizens are on the rolls, it should take appropriate steps to remove them. But that is not what the Sunshine State was doing. Rather, the state created a list rife with errors that many local election officials warned from the start was inaccurate. This flawed list was used to send purge notices to hundreds of eligible citizens, disproportionately Hispanic and members of other minority groups. Among them was Bill Internicola, a Brooklyn-born 91-year-old WWII veteran, who said he was \"flabbergasted\" when he received such a letter. Another view: Economic policies will discourage Hispanics, not voter ID laws . Last week, the same judge who stopped part of Florida's registration law scolded the state for the \"major flaws\" in its purge, which was \"likely to have a discriminatory impact\" on the tens of thousands of newly naturalized citizens in the state each year. Moving forward, Florida must create strict and uniform criteria for developing purge lists, as suggested in the Brennan Center's 2008 \"Voter Purges\" report, one of the first systematic examinations of the chaotic and largely unseen world of purges. Sadly, the news isn't all good. The Brennan Center estimates that 16 states have passed restrictive voting laws that have the potential to affect the 2012 election. These states account for 214 electoral votes, or 79% of the total needed to win the presidency. Elections should not be decided by politicians who manipulate voting laws for partisan gain. Improving our elections need not come at the expense of our shared value that all citizens should have the opportunity to participate in our democracy. If we truly want to make our election system better -- and get past the voting wars seen in Florida, Michigan and across the country -- the first step is to modernize voter registration, which could add more than 50 million eligible voters to the rolls, permanently. Even though voter files are kept on computers, citizens must fill out paper forms to register, and can be dropped from the rolls due to errors or address changes. Modernizing registration would use digital technology to enable citizens to register and stay registered to vote, and to update their registration online. In recent years, at least 21 states have moved forward to automate voter registration at Department of Motor Vehicle offices, a step supported by officials from both parties. Experiences in the states demonstrate that this increases accuracy and registration rates, minimizes the potential for fraud and saves money. All eligible citizens should have the opportunity -- and responsibility -- to vote. The right way to honor our Founding Fathers is to ensure their bold ideals of equality of opportunity are upheld. Let's make our election system better, and reject measures that restrict access to the polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence Norden.",
    "summary": "Lawrence Norden: Since 2011, more than two dozen restrictive voting measures have passed . Fortunately, some states have rejected them, as Michigan did Tuesday, says Norden . Florida will probably not resume its notorious purging of voter rolls, he says . Norden: Modernizing voter registration could add 50 million eligible voters to the rolls ."

    "document": "(CNN) -- They do daredevil stunts on the nation's highways and byways, popping wheelies even while standing on the seat, swarmed by a vanguard of other bikers as if they've taken over the road. Their motorcycles aren't the Harleys of old. They're called \"crotch rockets,\" a high-performance motorbike allowing drivers to ride on one wheel for blocks, with legs spread-eagled. It's like the X Games meet street bikes. And their stunts are captured by cameras on their helmets, posted online with hip-hop music. This is the world of stunt bikers, whose road conduct is at the center of a national debate after a violent, videotaped confrontation between them and a family in a Range Rover on a New York City highway. At least six motorcyclists -- including an off-duty undercover officer riding with the biker club -- have been charged in the September 29 attack on the SUV driver, who was dragged from his car and beaten. Car drivers, some law authorities and critics portray this new breed of stunt bikers as reckless motorists imperiling the public. But the bikers, their families and attorneys dispute the outlaw characterizations and say the vast majority are law-abiding enthusiasts -- not hellions on a hog as depicted in the TV drama \"Sons of Anarchy.\" \"Pop culture has driven this image\" of lawlessness, said Stephen Stubbs, a Nevada attorney for 43 motorcycle clubs. \"The big problem here is this: Motorcyclists are second-class citizens. That's a fact.\" But the co-founder of an annual bikers gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, says he foresaw disaster in stunt biking years ago. He quit the theatrics, especially after his biker rally grew out of control. The Ride of the Century began as a meeting of about 250 bikers in 2001, said Dennis Cardwell. Now 2,000 bikers show up, and police say the motorcyclists' high-speed stunts are now a major traffic hazard, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. The bikers even blew through a police roadblock on Interstate 70 two years ago, which was captured on YouTube video, the station said. At this year's event in August, police confiscated dozens of motorcycles and arrested several bikers, the affiliate said. What began as bikers filming themselves to make money off their skills and doing it safely 12 years ago turned into something distressing for Cardwell, he told CNN. \"It became a monster,\" he said. Prosecutor: Off-duty officer 'terrorized' family as SUV driver was beaten . He worried about younger, inexperienced riders doing stunts beyond their ability. Cardwell and friends would be \"scared out of our mind about what might happen,\" he said. He feared for his own safety amid scores of cyclists he considered reckless. He also worried about car drivers near them. \"I've seen some scary stuff,\" Cardwell said. Sometimes riders will carry batteries in their pockets, and \"if the car does something to make them mad they'll throw them at the window,\" Cardwell said. Cardwell said the video recording pushes the stunt bikers to do death-defying tricks. \"There's kids that want their 15 minutes of fame or that quick glory,\" Cardwell said. \"I guess you'll get some bad seeds in the bunch every so often that they think cutting cars off and just basically taking up the whole highway with no regard for anyone else is the way to do that, to impress their friends.\" The 35-year-old married father of three no longer owns a street bike -- just a dirt bike. He gave up street riding in 2006 about when his first child was born. He now feels stunt riding should be kept off the street. \"If you are going to do (tricks), go to a parking lot,\" he said. But current organizers of the St. Louis biker event took exception with Cardwell's remarks and said his comments are \"NOT the opinion of Ride of the Century or Streetfighterz,\" the Ride group said on its Facebook page. Streetfighterz is an affiliate of the event and \"one of the original stunt groups to help launch this crazy and exciting industry,\" its Facebook page said. Streetfighterz describes itself as a street-bike freestyle stunt team founded in 1999 in St. Louis, and its website sells several black T-shirts and hoodies, including one bearing the legend: \"\"Kill it All: Highways, Streets, Lots.\" New York police: Bikers stomped on SUV driver . \"We are of the opinion that riders ride for their own reasons and passion, and to comment on NATIONAL TELEVISION about an incident that happened thousands of miles away is irresponsible and disrespectful to the riders and families involved,\" the Ride of the Century group said in a statement. \"Just wanted to make clear his lack of judgment and uneducated comments were not representative of ROC or Streetfighterz.\" The wife of one motorcyclist injured in the New York confrontation also disputed portrayals of the bikers as a lawless swarm. Dayana Mejia said her husband was trying to help the driver of the Range Rover when it ran him over, breaking his spine in two places and fracturing multiple ribs. Edwin Mieses is now paralyzed, Mejia said. Mieses, 32, a father of two children, isn't a member of any gang and just loved riding his motorcycles with dozens of friends, his attorney added. \"I can't blame anyone. I can understand why he was scared,\" Mejia said about the driver of the Range Rover. \"But at the end of the day, my husband parked his vehicle on a kick stand to get off, to try help the situation. Told everyone to move on, let's just go, let's get away, let's just move, ignore him,\" referring to the driver of the SUV, she said. Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles attorney representing Mieses, said her client wasn't even driving his motorcycle when the Range Rover struck him. He was encouraging everyone to return to riding and move along. \"He was doing everything lawfully,\" she said. Mieses was run over and crushed as his back was turned to the SUV and its driver, Alexian Lien, according to Allred. \"Whether one likes people who ride motorcycles is not the issue,\" Allred said. \"Are people so blinded by their fears and prejudices in this case that they cannot see that before anyone laid a hand on Mr. Lien, that Edwin Mieses was run over and left severely injured? Where is the justice in that?\" But a retired Nassau County, New York, police officer told CNN that his review of the recorded confrontation showed the driver had no option but to run people down. In the beating, Lien suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, a police detective's criminal complaint said. \"In my opinion, he was in fear for his life. He had a baby in the car. I don't think that he believes he has any other option,\" said Lou Palumbo, who now runs a security business. The real issue, he asserted, was \"the volume of motorcycles.\" If car drivers ever find themselves in such a situation, he said, \"Call 911, No. 1, and just basically try to yield right of way to these bikes.\" Opinion: In attack, can bikers get a fair shake .

    "document": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to increase spending on efforts to break into U.S. military computer systems, expand its Navy, and invest in intercontinental nuclear missiles and weapons to destroy satellites, according to the latest U.S report on China's military power. Chinese military officers after a meeting about the People's Liberation Army in 2007. The annual report from the Pentagon to Congress says China's total military spending in 2007 was between $97 billion and $139 billion, but it is hard to tell exactly how much was spent and on what. In comparison, the U.S. military budget request for 2008 is $481.4 billion, not including war requests. Pentagon officials said a chunk of China's spending went to cyberwarfare, because 2007 saw several \"intrusions\" believed to be from the Peoples Liberation Army. In the incidents, unclassified U.S. military computer systems were broken into and information was taken, according to Pentagon officials. While the information taken was not classified, Pentagon officials said the worry is the Chinese hacking required many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for a computer network attack. Last summer, a cyber-attack on Department of Defense computer systems took down the e-mail capability of hundreds of staffers for weeks, but the Pentagon still will not comment on who initiated the attack. It is widely believed among the military to have been the Peoples Liberation Army. China is also investing heavily in and fielding improved nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and antisatellite missiles, according to the report. The United States expressed its concern last year after China fired a missile at one of its old satellites and destroyed it, sending thousands of dangerous pieces of space debris into orbit. The United States conducted a similar strike last month on a broken U.S. spy satellite before it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. U.S. officials said the satellite was hit and broke into thousands of small pieces that burned up as they re-entered Earth's atmosphere. The United States is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the Chinese navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers. The Chinese once had a small Navy. Now the United States is keeping an eye on the growing service amid concerns over Taiwan. The concerns include \"China's near-term focus on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, including the possibility of U.S. intervention, which is an important driver of its modernization,\" the report says. Additionally, the Chinese have placed about 100 more short-range missiles on the shore opposite Taiwan in the past year, it says. Pentagon officials worry the continued increase in Chinese military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between China and Taiwan in China's favor. The United States has said it would help defend Taiwan if China invaded. The report also says the Peoples Liberation Army is \"pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration, high-intensity conflicts along its periphery against high-tech adversaries.\" Such an army, the report says, would have \"the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could, over time, offset traditional U.S. military advantages.\" The United States says the lack of transparency by the Chinese on its spending poses \"risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,\" and that China has yet to explain to the international community the purpose of its military expansion, Pentagon officials said.

PUBLISHED: . 05:25 EST, 8 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:26 EST, 8 June 2012 . Intolerance: Russian President Vladimir Putin takes a hard-line against protesters . A new hard line law that will fine protesters a year's salary is awaiting President Vladimir Putin's signature. Putin has cracked down on the opposition since returning to the presidency, and he seems to be betting that by threatening demonstrators with prison time and harsh fines he can quash the street protests that have posed an unprecedented challenge to his 12-year rule. His strategy faces a major test on Tuesday when the opposition plans its first mass demonstration since he began his third presidential term on May 7. Some opposition leaders contend that . the tough line will help their cause by fueling anger and bringing more . people out for next week's protest. Others say the repression will scare . away the middle-class protesters who turned out in the tens of . thousands for peaceful demonstrations this winter. Putin, for his part, is refusing any talks with the opposition. 'He understands only one language, . the language of force, and therefore he perceives any normal discussion . and any rational compromise as personal weakness,' said Yevgenia . Chirikova, an environmental activist who has campaigned against . Kremlin-backed road construction that is destroying a forest outside . Moscow. Chirikova and Ilya Yashin, who recently spent 15 days in jail for leading unsanctioned protests, were among a group of opposition leaders who met Thursday in Moscow to discuss the implications of the new law, which would jack up fines to 300,000 rubles ($9,000). Yashin tried to ease worries, saying . protest leaders would collect donations for those punished, as was done . within hours when St. Petersburg teacher Tatyana Ivanova was fined . 30,000 rubles ($1,000) last week. Ivanova . was found guilty of damaging the reputation of an education department . official she had accused of pressuring her and other poll workers to . falsify the December parliamentary vote. Repression: Opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov, left, with environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova tear a picture of Putin to pieces at a protest earlier this year. Dissidents could be fined a year's wages if the new law goes ahead . Russian police detain a protester near the Kremlin in Moscow on Wednesday. Street protests have posed an unprecedented challenge to Putin's 12-year-rule . The anti-Putin protests broke out after the December election, which observers said was riddled with fraud in favor of Putin's party, and continued in the run-up to the March presidential vote. As many as 100,000 people turned out in the frigid cold for demonstrations demanding free elections, and the streets of Moscow rang with cries of 'Russia Without Putin' and 'Putin Is a Thief.' Although he was denied a majority in Moscow, Putin won the election to return to the Kremlin post he had held from 2000 to 2008 before moving into the prime minister's office to avoid violating a constitutional ban on more than two consecutive terms. With the election over, the protest movement seemed to fade. But on the eve of Putin's inauguration in May, an opposition march and rally drew tens of thousands, far more than either the organisers or the police had expected. The demonstration turned violent . after police restricted access to the square where the rally was to be . held. Bottles and pieces of asphalt were hurled at police, who struck . back by beating protesters with truncheons and detaining more than 400. Some demonstrators were dragged away by their hair. Opposition leaders . claim the clash was provoked by pro-Kremlin thugs. Violence: Russian riot police try to disperse opposition protesters on May 6. New legislation would provide police with new powers against Occupy-style camps . In the days that followed, police chased opposition activists around the city, detaining hundreds. Then the crackdown eased, as the authorities allowed the opposition to set up camp on a leafy boulevard. But there were strings attached: The organisers could not put up placards or make political demands, since that would technically turn the camp into an unsanctioned protest. The authorities tolerated the camp for about a week before getting a court to rule that the activists were creating a mess in the neighborhood, giving police the legal right to disperse them. The anti-protest legislation also would provide police with new powers against such Occupy-style camps. 'Large-scale public gatherings' could be banned and the organisers fined if they disrupted public order. In a Levada poll released Thursday, 65 percent said they expected the protests to continue, although they differed on how likely the protests were to intensify or spread. The poll, conducted May 25-29 among 1,604 people across Russia, has a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points. The bill was rushed through the Kremlin-controlled parliament this week in an effort to get it in place before Tuesday's big protest. Some opposition leaders held out hope that Putin would refuse to sign it. Others, however, said they had no illusions, pointing to a comment by Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov after the violence on the eve of the inauguration. Protesters who hurt riot police, he said, 'should have their livers smeared on the asphalt.'It was the kind of language that Putin likes.",

    "document": "An auction house is providing a rare opportunity to buy a 500-year-old piece of natural history by selling bones from a dodo bird for the first time in 80 years. The leg and pelvis from the flightless bird, which died out in the mid-17th century, represent the first opportunity to purchase a complete part of the animal's skeleton since 1934. The anonymous vendor is believed to be one of only three people left in the world who privately own dodo bones, with most now on display in museums. Rare opportunity: The leg (left) and pelvis bone (right) from the extinct dodo are the first on sale since 1934 . The pair were part of a large collection of remains discovered by a British schoolmaster 220 years after the bird became extinct. In 1886 George Clarke went to Mauritius, the only place the dodo is said to have lived, and hired slaves to wade through a swamp and feel for the bones with their feet. The leg and pelvis, which are being sold by Summers Place Auctions of Billingshurst in West Sussex, are said to be worth more than £30,000 together and are both in excellent states of preservation. Earlier this year, a fragment of a femur was sold for £8,000 by auction house Christie's in London. Dodos were first spotted by Dutch sailors who arrived on the Indian Ocean isle in 1598, but the final sighting was only 64 years later in 1662. Sparse: A replica skeleton of a dodo. Only 10 museums around the world are set to have sets of dodo bones, but most are composites . While it is thought they were hunted to extinction by humans, another belief is that macaque monkeys plundered dodo nests after being introduced on Mauritius. Errol Fuller, a natural history expert and curator for the auction, said: 'Most dodo bones that exist today were found in a swamp in Mauritius by George Clarke. 'The remains went to museums and private collectors but over the years they have gradually gravitated to museums. 'Only about 10 museums in the world have a complete dodo skeleton and most of them are composites. 'Physical remains of the bird in private hands today hardly exist. There are only two or three people in the world privately who have dodo bones. Drawing: The dodo (or Raphus cucullatus) was first spotted by Dutch sailors who arrived on Mauritius in 1598 . 'The last complete dodo bone was sold in 1934 in London. There will be a lot of interest in these two items. There are dodo fans all over the world and there are lots of them. Around 200 years after they had died out, dodo birds started to gain a mythical status due to Victorian author Lewis Carroll. He was inspired to write the creature into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland after seeing the head of one at a museum in Oxford. Mr Fuller added: 'The dodo was so extreme looking yet nobody really took much notice of them until the 1860s when Lewis Carroll wrote about one in Alice in Wonderland. 'That generated an interest in the bird that has never ceased. If you go to Mauritius today you can by souvenir dodo T-shirts and ashtrays. 'And of course the dodo is regarded as a symbol of extinction, mainly due to the saying 'dead as a dodo.'",

The Australian activist who disrupted last year’s Boat Race has won his battle against deportation after claiming his fellow countrymen would be racist to his wife who is of Indian descent. Trenton Oldfield, 37, had his application to remain in the country refused earlier this year after the Home Office deemed his presence ‘undesirable’ following the incident. But the protester, who was sentenced to six months in prison as a result of his publicity stunt, won on appeal after arguing that Australians were ‘passive aggressive’ racists. Trenton Oldfield appears at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in central London for an extradition hearing . He said that if he was forced to return to his home country, he would not be able to bring his wife Deepa Naik, who is of Indian descent, or his daughter. He said: ‘Australia to Deepa... is a particularly racist country. There are particularly racist attacks on people of Indian descent.’ Mr Oldfield went on to say while most of it was ‘water cooler’ or unintentional racism, some Indians in Australia had been burned and physically assaulted. ‘I don’t think I could put either Deepa or my child through that,’ he said. Oldfield disrupted the annual Oxford v Cambridge competition in April last year as a protest against what he described as ‘entrenched elitism’. He had his application for a spousal visa refused earlier this year but he won on appeal yesterday at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in Islington, north London. The protester, who has a five-month-old daughter, told judge Kevin Moore that he was inspired to disrupt the race after caring for his British wife’s father, who was suffering from cancer. ‘I think I was vulnerable in terms of realising how short life can be,’ he sobbed to the court. ‘I saw poverty and I saw the laws the government were passing that were going to make life substantially harder. ‘I think I was very emotional. When you go around London, you can see the pockets of deprivation that still exist.’ Outside court, Oldfield told reporters: ‘I’m delighted to be able to get back to my work and spend time with my family.’ He thanked his supporters, but said the public interest surrounding the case should highlight the problems surrounding deportation threats. ‘What I would like to say is this happens every single day in this building to all sorts of people and we need to start paying attention to these people who are experiencing what can be quite a violent experience of having the state come down on you,’ he said. ‘Deportation is an old ideal and it’s from another time - 1,000 years ago. ‘We need to rethink that and the media’s attention needs to be on not me anymore, but the people who are going in and out of this building and that is where the real issues are.’ Protest: Trenton Oldfield, accompanied by his wife, Deepa Naik and their child, appeared at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in central London today for a hearing regarding extradition back to Australia. Oldfield, disrupted last year's University Boat Race on London's River Thames by swimming into the path of the crews . Oldfield said his wife had never been to Australia and had no interest in doing so. ‘Meeting Deepa was like meeting the person you’d always been searching for,’ he said. ‘We’re muses for each other, but also our strongest critics. ‘Everything we do is together. Every single part of our life is entangled together.’ Oldfield said he worked with his wife in not-for-profit organisations and various charities. ‘I fell in love with London within two hours of arriving,’ he said. ‘There was room for people like me... who were interested in justice, interested in fairness.’ Oldfield said he regretted many aspects of his protest, particularly the impact it had on his family and he would not be repeating his actions. Miss Naik, who had to leave the hearing at times to comfort the couple’s crying daughter, later told the tribunal that he wanted to act against inequality. ‘When Trenton swam in the Thames, he had no idea at the time the potential consequence would be a prison sentence,’ she said. ‘It is the first and only time Trenton has done a protest like this.’ Miss Naik said she did not want to think what would happen if he was deported. ‘It’s something I don’t want to fathom,’ she said. ‘It would mean the destruction of everything we’ve ever worked on.’ Miss Naik said she did not want to go to Australia because she did not have any family or support networks there. She added that Australia’s strict immigration laws would mean there would be a forced separation between Oldfield and his family. Outside court, Oldfield told reporters: 'I'm delighted to be able to get back to my work and spend time with my family' The judge heard from an Oxford professor who commended Oldfield’s work and the court was handed a petition against his deportation signed by 265 Cambridge and Oxford staff and students. Darren Morley, representing the Home Office, said although the protester had some desirable characteristics, he still broke the law. ‘The appellant was not trying to live within the laws of a country that welcomed him and helped him build a life here,’ he said. But Stephanie Harrison QC, for Oldfield, argued her client’s good work in the community outweighed the incident and caused only minimal disruption to the race. ‘He has been trying... to make a difference to people’s lives who are on the rough end of society,’ she said. ‘He should not be doubly punished.’ Judge Moore agreed, saying he thought Mr Oldfield was of good character. ‘It would be my intention to allow the appeal,’ he said to sighs of relief from Mr Oldfield and his supporters. A Home Office spokesperson said: ‘Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We refused this individual leave to remain because we do not believe his presence in this country is conducive to the public good. ‘As we are awaiting the Judge’s written determination in this case, it would not be appropriate to comment further.’",

    "document": "(CNN) -- \"I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession,\" Hillary Clinton famously snapped on the campaign trail two decades ago Friday. Mostly, we remember the comment as a moment in the perpetual mommy wars, but I tend to think about it as a moment in the history of chocolate chip cookies. Capitalizing on the political gaffe, Family Circle challenged Clinton to a bake-off, and she obliged, providing an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe that handily defeated Barbara Bush's variant. (You can still find it winning rave reviews online.) Home-baked cookies struck at the heart of what we thought mothering was all about. It's still true today, but we have given it new meaning. In 1992, Clinton's comment drew scorching responses from at-home mothers and cheers from fellow working moms. Such polarized reactions should be set in the context of Clinton's own life. Among the few women in her Yale Law School class, Clinton fought hard for professional success. Her remark was not merely a political misstep, but a generational declaration: a reflection of gut-level struggles women had made for workplace opportunity, even as mothers. Yet, the long reach of what was, after all, an offhand remark touches on something deeper than a mere episode in the nation's contrived reality show, \"Mom v. Mom.\" Through the twists and turns of that cookie-baking scandal, we experienced the birthing pains of the working family. An idealized image of mothering stays powerfully with us: children arriving home from school, met at the door with warm chocolate chip cookies and a motherly embrace. That image evokes devotion, time and, most importantly, love. It is middle-class parenting unstressed by the demands of labor, whether paid or unpaid (the pans and trays awaiting washing are generally conveniently left out of the picture). What was true 20 years ago is still true today: Many of us struggle with profound ambivalence about the demands that mothers' paid labor make on that idealized possibility. We long to care without pressure. The still distinct memory of Clinton's unsavvy comment speaks to a deep-seated cultural experience of loss. With more than two-thirds of mothers in the labor force today, few families are immune to negotiating child care and paid work. The plate of chocolate chip cookies embodies our desire for parenting and family space free of the demands of our paid jobs. Still, there are signs of change. \"Working family\" was a term newly in use when Clinton made her famous comment, but working mothers have been, however messily and tentatively, forging a new model of parenting and laboring since that time. Parents' priorities have changed, but not at the expense of their kids. Recent studies of time use by sociologists at the University of Maryland show employed mothers spending as much time in primary child care as nonemployed mothers in 1975. Working-family mothers live with messier houses but report higher levels of enjoyment in their children's company than three decades ago. Today's working mother may be mixing up fewer batches of cookies, but when she does, she's often baking with the kids -- the activity not so much abandoned, as reserved for moments that matter to parent and child. This new pragmatism doesn't mean there's no lingering guilt. The middle-class parents who still suffer most, I suspect, from cookie angst could learn from working-class women who have long seen good parenting in providing. Devotion to children can come in the form of earning what it takes to put treats on the table. And they would do well to listen to another first lady, Michelle Obama, who as a black woman is well schooled in the multiple roles that black women, whether middle class or poor, have long fulfilled. Black mothers historically have believed they are dedicated mothers, even while earning money for their families. No one assumed that Obama, in her lawyer days before the White House, devoted herself to cookie making, but we knew she was a good mother. Although it has not been as widely reported about as her gardens, Obama has been a voice for working families in the White House, speaking regularly on behalf of work-life initiatives. True, her shortbread cookies lost to Cindy McCain's oatmeal-butterscotch in Family Circle's 2008 bake-off. But more telling was that Working Mother magazine named her one of the country's most powerful working moms in 2011. I have always been embarrassed by Clinton's cookies. They seemed like a capitulation to politics seeking to turn back the clock on women's roles. But I have begun to think that I shouldn't be. Twenty years ago Friday, that first lady campaigner made a divisive declaration on working motherhood. Perhaps we should see Clinton's successful decades in the public limelight since as a lesson in the new pragmatism. Like Clinton, we can have our cookies, and careers, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kirsten Swinth.",
    "summary": "Kirsten Swinth: Hillary Clinton's \"cookie-baking\" remark stung women 20 years ago . Swinth: In hindsight, it spoke to women's struggles balancing home and the workplace .

    "document": "An Indiana anesthesiologist shot dead his wife minutes after the last guest left their wedding party early on Sunday morning after an alleged alcohol fueled argument over a pre-nuptial agreement turned tragic. Dr. George 'Scott' Samson, 54, is said to have told his new wife, Kelly Ecker, 50, that she would 'never get her hands on his money' during the wedding reception at the Ohio Building in Terre Haute on Saturday evening. According to witnesses, the argument became increasingly bitter when the wedding after-party moved to Samson and Ecker's mansion, with guests deciding to leave at 1.17am on Sunday morning as the fighting escalated. Scroll Down for Video . Tragedy: George 'Scott' Samson and Kelly Ecker married on Saturday evening and returned to Samson's Terre Haute home for their wedding party . Shock: Kelly Ecker with her friend's Charlene Bloodworth (left) and Britany Wright (right). The pictures are believed to show Kelly in her wedding dress on Saturday eveninf . Three minutes after the final guest departed, Ecker, who is a nurse at the same hospital as Samson, made the first of three terrified 911 calls claiming her husband was going to kill her. The first two frantic calls to the dispatcher ended abruptly, but moments later Ecker phoned back, her trembling voice pleading for help, before a volley of gunshots rang out and the phone line cut. Less than half-an-hour later, officers who who responded to the couple's Terre Haute home discovered the body of Ecker, fatally shot in the head and neck and in the basement the body of Samson, who had taken his own life with a 45-caliber semi automatic pistol. According to Advance Indiana, the reception had been changed from the newlywed's home to the Ohio Building at the last minute and the marquee tent set up in their garden still hauntingly sits outside their home. Police said that Samson shot his wife multiple times with a 40-caliber handgun and records show that the Terre Haute doctor held a Federal Firearms License, which effectively enabled him to trade and sell weapons from his property - in a manner similar to a gun store owner. Indeed, according to Advance Indiana, police recovered a literal arsenal of weapons from the home, including assault rifles, hand guns and several hundred rounds of ammunition. 'They had just gotten married and something went terribly wrong,' said Vigo County Coroner, Dr. Susan Amos. 'He shot her and then shot himself. We are still in a second autopsy to confirm that.' Witnesses told the IndyStar that the couple had argued at the end of their reception and the final guest left anesthesiologist Samson's home at 1.17am. Frantic cries for help: Kelly Ecker phoned 911 in the early hours of Sunday morning to plead for help from her husband who she claimed was trying to kill her . Friends: Kelly Ecker poses with one of her co-workers before her wedding to George 'Scott' Samson on Saturday . Scene: George 'Scott' Samson and Ecker's 10-year-old son (left). Ecker posted the picture of Samson's home to Facebook in July commenting that she was delighted to be moving in with her son. She was found dead in his bedroom at the property. The 10-year-old was unharmed . Ecker, a nurse at Union Hospital, phoned 911 at 1.20am after witnesses said their argument about money spiraled out of control. 'The investigation has revealed that there was an verbal argument between the couple toward the end of the reception, which carried over to the after party at the couples' home,' said Vigo County Chief Deputy Sheriff Clark Cottom in an email to the IndyStar. 'Shortly after the last guest left at around 1:17 a.m., Kelly Ecker Samson called 911 reporting that her husband had threatened to kill her. 'There were a total of three very brief 911 calls, which in the first two the caller disconnected.' Cottom said that Ekcer was found in the bedroom her 10-year-old son from a previous relationship slept in, while Samson shot himself once in the head with a registered gun. Haunting: The marquee tent erected in the garden of Samson's home still stands the day after the tragic murder suicide . 'Deputies did find the female victim inside the child's bedroom deceased,' said Cottom to WISHTV. Cottom said that Ekcer's son and an elderly couple believed to be Samson's parents were inside the home at the time of the shooting, but were not harmed and escorted out by police when they arrived. 'We received information from the elderly male that the female's husband Scott Samson had retreated to the basement,' said Cottom to WISHTV. 1st CALL . Dispatch: '911 what's the address of your emergency?' Tragic notes left by friends: Kelly Ecker at a Christmas party with Brooke Llewelyn . Kelly: '4205 North Creal. Please. Dispatch: What's the address?' Kelly: '4205 North Creal.' Dispatch: 'Ok what's going on there?' Kelly: 'He's beating the s*** out of me.' Dispatch: 'Who is?' Kelly: 'My husband.' Dispatch: Who's your husband?' Kelly: 'Scott Samson. He's got guns inside. Call ends . Dispatcher then called back, but that call was answered and then hung up . 3rd CALL . Kelly: 'Help!' Dispatch: 'What's the address of your emergency?' Kelly: '4205 North Creal.' Dispatch: 'Ok 4205...' Kelly Interrupts... Kelly: 'Oh my God!' (Multiple shots are heard being fired) Call ends . Samson, 54, is a doctor at Union Hospital in Taure Haute and one witness told WISHTV that guests left the wedding party because of the argument that the newlyweds were having. 'They were having some domestic problems at the house. Within a short amount of time guests decided it would be best if they left. Shortly after the last guest left that's when things went terribly wrong,' said Cottom. When police arrived, they discovered the basement locked and so had to call out the Terre Haute Police Department Special Response Team. 'The remote camera was able to determine he was in the basement, unresponsive,' said Cottom. Friends such as Brooke Llewellyn took to Facebook to express their grief at the loss of their friend. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine on this day that our time as friends would be cut so short,' wrote Brooke.

    "document": "(CNN) -- The Army sergeant who admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan is expected to take the stand at his sentencing hearing and will apologize. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty in June to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts. The plea spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings. He now faces life in prison, but a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel will decide whether he will have a chance at parole. \"Yes, Bob will take (the) stand ... Yes, Bob will apologize,\" Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne said in an e-mail to CNN. Bales admitted to slipping away from his outpost in southern Afghanistan and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012, a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies.

Mikkelson also tweeted from the sentencing hearing, which began this week at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington. So far, a number of Afghan civilians have taken the stand for the prosecution to talk about what they saw and survived. Haji Mohammed Wazir lost 11 relatives -- his wife, mother, two brothers, a 13-year-old nephew and six of his seven children -- according to KING. \"My life has never been the same,\" Wazir told the jury. It's been more than a year since the massacre, but Wazir said: \"I feel like it's happening right now,\" the affiliate reported. KING's Mikkelson tweeted that a 12-year-old boy who survived the rampage testified about seeing his father and sister get shot. Another witness broke down on the stand and cried out: \"For God's sake, don't ask me any more questions,\" Mikkelson wrote. In addition to the murder counts, Bales pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder, seven of assault and the use of illicit steroids and alcohol. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice. Bales is a member of the Army's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the 2nd Infantry Division. His attorneys have said the service made a mistake in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq.

As of 5 a.m. ET Sunday, Tomas, a tropical storm with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Curacao, according to the Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at about 14 mph (22 kph). Tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the center of Tomas. Tomas moved over the Caribbean Sea after leaving heavy rain and wind on St. Vincent. More than 1,000 people entered shelters on St. Vincent as Tomas struck the island, an emergency official said. Two people were injured, including one critically, when they tried to repair roof damage during the storm, said Michelle Forbes, acting director of National Emergency Management. Tomas also left downed trees that blocked many roads, Forbes said, and large areas of the island lacked power. More than 100 homes sustained roof damage, she said, and authorities expected the number to rise. The main hospital on the island, Milton Cato Memorial Hospital, lost power temporarily but was able to get a generator up and running, according to Forbes. Tomas was forecast to continue heading west over the next day or two. The Hurricane Center said restrengthening could begin by late Tuesday. A projection map shows the storm turning north later this week. Tomas could approach Haiti on Friday, possibly as a hurricane. Tomas could deal a harsh blow to Haiti as the impoverished nation is still recovering from a devastating earthquake in January and is currently dealing with a cholera outbreak. But \"Tomas could still hit anywhere from the Dominican Republic to eastern Cuba,\" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. CNN Radio's Matt Cherry contributed to this report.",

He has been on hunger strike since August 24, according to the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. Bahraini authorities released a statement Monday citing a \"case that was presented to them from the Bahrain airport police.\" Without mentioning Maryam al-Khawaja by name, the statement said the \"accused person\" had an outstanding warrant and was arrested upon arriving in Bahrain, according to Abdullah al-Dossary, district attorney for al-Muharraq province. \"At that point, while she was being searched, she was asked by the police to surrender her telephone, which she refused and assaulted a police officer and a female police officer and caused injuries as accompanied by the medical reports,\" the statement said. In the presence of her attorney, the woman was charged with assaulting a state employee while performing official duties, based on witness statements and the medical reports of the officers who were allegedly attacked, al-Dossary said. She was then sent to jail for seven days while the investigation is conducted, the statement said. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's other daughter was also briefly detained after attempting to visit her father Thursday, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said.

During today's live broadcast of The Five, Bob Beckel was seated with the usual hosts as they weighed the issue of the proposed nudity ban in San Francisco. Dana Perino sparked a debate when she inquired of her cohorts: 'What happened to these people as children that they don’t want to wear any clothes?' Scroll down for video . Shock claim: Bob Beckel suggested that sexual assault was to blame when asked why anyone would like to strut around San Francisco without clothes on . Reaction: Co-host Dana Perino, right, looked as if she couldn't believe what she was hearing as Beckel spoke during the live show . Naked passion: Protester Gypsy Taub speaks out against the Board of Supervisors decision to ban public nakedness . Andrea Tantaros suggested that those pushing back against the nudity ban are 'desperate for attention.' But Beckel's opinion on the matter was a tad more extreme: 'Most of them were gang banged probably. While his stunned co-hosts cringed, Beckel added: 'I don’t know - they could have had sexual assault on them.' Nude protest: A naked demonstrator sits on the steps of City Hall in San Francisco as the ban was voted on by the council . Equally stunned were viewers who took to Twitter to voice their outrage over Beckel's comments. One user tweeted: 'I wonder if [Perino] is proud to sit & made to shut up next to the misogynist men on [Fox News]. This is disgusting.' Another suggested that Beckel has 'evolved from the village idiot.' One more suggested that Beckel's remark earns him the distinction of the 'Joe Biden of Fox News.'

    "document": "A photographer has documented the struggles of California women who give birth while in jail and others who are bringing up their children in prison. Photojournalist Mae Ryan captured the images of women at facilities in Chino and Pomona who were among the estimated four per cent of state and three per cent of federal inmates that are pregnant. Her photos expose the complicated lives of many inmates who are separated from their children after only hours together or others trying to be good mothers while behind bars. Scroll down for video . Photographer Mae Ryan captured images of women at California prisons. Above, Denise Bussell, in prison for having three DUIs in ten years, sits with son Justice in the Community Prisoner Mother Program . Regina Zodiacal was getting ready to give birth when Ms Ryan shot her Pregnant in Prison series in 2013 . Ms Ryan's work explores two centers in California, where 200 mothers gave birth while incarcerated in the state between 2011 and 2012. The pregnant women the photographer met in 2013 are given pre-natal care by a resident gynaecologist before their births. They are then taken to local hospitals for their births, which cost the state between $6,500 to $14,000 per birth, according to Feature Shoot. However, the time after giving birth can be harrowing for the mothers. Women, waiting for photos or news of newborns that they gave to relatives, develop post-partum depression. Others struggle with physical pain of pregnancy while watching their children given to foster care. Christina Bray already had three children when she went into labor while being arrested for embezzling money from a banking client. She said through tears that she held her daughter Lola Mae close to her heart before having to let her go, according to KPCC. Women who deliver while incarcerated are given between 24 and 48 hours with their newborns. Ms Zodiacal, five months pregnant when she was arrested for shoplifting and forgery, was worried that she would not be heard if she went into labor in her cell . Prison inmates are transported to local hospitals by guards in order to give birth, which costs between $6,500 and $14,000 . An estimated four per cent of state prisoners and three per cent of federal inmates are thought to be pregnant . 'There's really no after care here. They just handed me a Kotex pad and said have a good day,' inmate Britney Bass, in prison because of a parole violation, said two weeks after giving birth. She said she was happy to finally be able to sit down without pain after being whisked back to the prison 48 hours after she delivered her baby and handed it over for adoption. Women who deliver while incarcerated are given between 24 and 48 hours with their newborns. The resident gynaecologist at the California Institute for Women, a state prison in Chino, said that many pregnant women come off the street and have not received any treatment before going to prison. Corazon Navarro said that the prison cannot afford to give inmates exceptional quality of care, but said that she tries to do the best she can. But pregnancy in prison often presents issues not thought about by those on the outside. Pregnant inmates meet with a gynaecologist like Corazan Navarro in the lead up to birth, though they say after care is lacking . The Community Prisoner Mother Program in Pomona allows women to live with their children under age six . Unoccupied cribs at the Community Prisoner Mother Program can be used for women to take care of their infants . Inmates getting ready to give births face worries beyond those normal for first-time mothers. Regina Zodiacal, who was five months pregnant when she was arrested for shoplifting and forgery, told Ms Ryan that they worried about going into labor while in their cells and wardens will not hear them, leaving them alone for the ordeal. Advocates for the rights of expectant women in California prisons also won a victory in 2012 when the state legislature passed a law prohibiting women from being shackled during their pregnancies. While many women give their children to relatives to take care of, some prisoners have the opportunity to live with their children in special facilities such as the Community Prisoner Mother Program in Pomona. The 24-bed facility only allows a select group of incarcerated mothers and has no armed guards and no barbed wires. It does, however, have a kindergarten. Inmates with children under six are allowed to live with their kids while developing 'skills necessary to become a functioning, self-sufficient family that positively contributes to society' according to the California Department of Corrections. An estimated 250,000 children are separated from their mothers because of incarceration, according to AETN. The Pomona center is designed to keep mothers and children together while the prisoners learn skills to help them reintegrate into society . Inmates are allowed to take their children to the playground or away from the facility for doctor appointments . Only 46 per cent of mothers in prison reported having a personal visit from their children since being incarcerated. However, inmates at the Mother Program are allowed to take their kids to a playground at the facility or even leave for doctor appointments. The women are required to do chores as they would in prison, but they are also able to read their children bedtime stories. Though children are thought to do better when not separated from their mothers, the environment is not often 'child friendly' and can seem more like a medical clinic than a home, according to a study from Legal Services for Women with Children. The advocacy group has pushed for better food and medical conditions at the facilities. Despite problems, the mothers said they wouldn't want their children anywhere else. Mrs Bray was eventually able to be reunited with Lola Mae after 13 months apart after she was accepted to the Pomona program. 'There is no home without a mother,' she said, adding that prisoners deserve second chances. Luckily for women at the facility, the situation is often temporary. Woman accepted to the program must be sentenced to 36 months or less. The same women accepted to the nursery program are often good candidates for being transferred to community supervision rather than prison. Christina Bray went into labor after being arrested for embezzlement and held baby Lola Mae to her chest . The mother was reunited with her daughter after 13 months after being accepted to the Pomona center's program .",

    "document": "By . Steph Cockroft . An angler has broken the record for the biggest fish ever caught off British shores - and it weighs more than a gorilla. The common skate fish, which was caught off the Isle of Skye, was so big that fisherman Daniel Bennett spent two hours struggling to reel it in. When he finally got back to shore, the 26-year-old from Whitby, North Yorkshire, discovered his catch weighed 208lbs - more than a female Eastern Lowland gorilla, a heavyweight boxer or a moped. What a catch! Daniel Bennett, 26, caught this 208lb skate fish while fishing off the Isle . of Skye - the biggest fish to be caught off British shores . The fish, a rare protected species similar to a stingray, was so large . that the angler spent two hours reeling it in to shore, before tossing . it back into the sea . Mr Bennett, who returned the fish back into the sea, said: 'The key to catching the fish was having a lot of . patience. My back is absolutely killing me now though. 'We’ve never caught anything on that scale before, and we guessed it weighed about 150lb. But it was 208lbs. I can’t believe it.' The fisherman caught the skate - a rare protected fish species that looks similar to a stingray - after it latched onto half a mackerel . fillet that Mr Bennett had used as bait. Skates have a flat body and wing-like pectoral fins attached to their head, like a stingray. There are dozens of species of skates but the common skate is the largest skate species. A common skate can reach up to more than 8 ft (96 inches) in length and 220lbs - though most males grow to around 60 inches. Skates, . which have a life span of around 50 years, can live in most parts of . the world - whether tropical seas or near-Arctic waters. They are usually found in deep waters but can also survive in shallow waters. The common skate is listed as a critically-endangered species. It is threatened both in the Atlantic . Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Their eggs, so-called mermaid’s purses, are often found on beaches and are oblong and protected by leathery cases. The catch, which was 88.25 inches long by . 66.75 inches wide, has now been confirmed by the British Record Fish Committee as the largest fish caught on its current list. Although the fish was not weighed at the scene, because the anglers did not have scales, the weight was worked out by The Shark Trust - a UK conservation charity - based on the measurements of the fish. Before that, the largest fish caught from British shores was a 159lb skate, which was reeled in on the Isle of Lewis in 1994. Those anglers have since become 'local celebrities' on Skye - but Mr Bennett says his girlfriend, Philippa, is not quite as impressed. Mr Bennett, who works in a fishing . supplies shop, said: 'My partner is not really that interested, but . she’s proud of me nonetheless. 'I think people outside the angling world . find it harder to see how much of a feat this is. 'West Scotland is known for skate fishing but not Skye. We were the first to catch one there for at least 30 or 40 years. 'There . was another chap in our group who caught one and it was about 120lb. We . thought we’d never find one any bigger - then we did an hour later.' The fish, which was 88.25inches long and 66.75inches wide, weighs more than a female gorilla, a heavyweight boxer or a moped and is the largest fish on record at the British Record Fish Committee . Nick Simmonds, secretary of the British Record Fish Committee, said: 'There is not a larger fish recorded as being caught on our current record list. 'Once we receive pictures from Dan we will pass them on to our scientist who will check the images and hopefully confirm the unofficial record. 'It can’t be confirmed as a record as it was not weighed at the scene. 'It will be seriously considered for the Notable Fish List, which was created for situations like this where the fish cannot be weighed. This list is historically important, at least in the angling world.' The fish weighs more than a female Eastern Lowland gorilla . Here are some other things which weigh around the same amount as the skate fish caught by Mr Bennett. That fish weighed 208lbs. Fully-stocked fridge: 215lbs . Sir Steve Redgrave in his prime: 220lbs . Female Eastern Lowland gorilla: 200lbs . Vespa moped: 197lbs . Heavyweight boxer: over 200lbs .",

    "document": "(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden recently confided a sensational bit of news to the New Yorker magazine: In a 2011 meeting with Vladimir Putin, he had actually told Russia's then-prime minister that he had no \"soul.\" Even more remarkable was Putin's response. \"And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, 'We understand one another.' \" Many people -- in Ukraine, Europe, America and even Russia -- probably share Biden and Putin's estimation of the Russian president's spiritual condition. In saying Putin has no soul, it means he seems to lack both the capacity to feel emotions and to show empathy. Russia's leader certainly has a long record of inhumanity. He was an agent of the Soviet secret police, a criminal institution with a record that goes back to the purges of Stalin, a record more bloody than that of the Nazi SS. John Dunlop of Stanford's Hoover Institution wrote in \"The Moscow Bombings\" that there is strong evidence to suggest that Putin was in on the plot to bomb two apartment buildings in Moscow in September 1999, in which 300 Russian citizens were killed and several hundred others were wounded. He says the bombings were blamed on Chechen rebels as a pretext to invade Chechnya. Putin has funded, promoted, supplied and aided and abetted the Russian and pro-Russian terrorists in eastern Ukraine. And by invading Crimea, he created the conditions of war, hatred and fanaticism that led to the destruction of 298 innocent lives aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on that day of infamy, July 17. Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels? Is Putin evil? His actions certainly are, if by evil we understand behavior that willfully, consciously and purposely destroys human life. Perhaps we can call his actions undeniably evil and Putin himself \"evil enough.\" Evil enough for what? Evil enough for condemnation by people of good will. How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies . If Putin is \"evil enough,\" what are the implications for policy-makers? First, they should openly state that they condemn Putin's behavior. Because silence implies approval, policy-makers must understand that their moral standing, like that of the countries they represent, is on the line. Evil is indivisible. If they refuse to condemn this instance, they effectively surrender the right to condemn any instance of evil. Second, they should refuse to shake his hand, engage in chitchat, attend photo ops with him and in any way create the impression that they accept his behavior as a socially acceptable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not hobnob with a German neo-Nazi; President Barack Obama would not have drinks with the head of the Ku Klux Klan. By extension, neither of them should hobnob with Putin at World Cup soccer games. Third, policy-makers should avoid doing anything that aids and abets Putin's proclivities. Since those proclivities largely rest on his ability to employ armaments to cause death, any form of assistance to Putin's war machine or repressive apparatus is the moral equivalent of supplying barbed wire and bullets to Auschwitz. Two examples will illustrate this point. The Dusseldorf-based German defense company Rheinmetall is manifestly abetting Putin's evildoing by continuing to insist that it has \"to meet its contractual obligations with Moscow and finalize a combat simulation center where up to 30,000 soldiers could be trained annually.\" Since Rheinmetall signed the contract with Russia in 2011, when Putin's record was already on full display to the world, it cannot claim ignorance of Putin's evil intentions. France's continued determination to supply the Putin war machine with two Mistral-class assault ships is no less of a moral outrage. As Robert C. O'Brien, a former U.S. representative to the United Nations, argues, \"With the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight No. 17, it should now be clear to all observers that Russia is fully intent on subjugating and intimidating its former Soviet constituent states and Warsaw Pact allies, and will do so with the most advanced weapons in its inventory. \"There is no reason to believe that the Mistral-class warships, once in the Russian Navy, will not also be used in the Black Sea, Baltic and Pacific to further increase the pressure on Russia's neighbors. Given its recent history, Moscow should not be handed another military tool of the Mistral-class magnitude.\" This does not mean that morally concerned policy makers should refrain from talking to him entirely. As professor Walter Clemens, an associate of Harvard's Davis Center, argues in a fascinating paper, \"Can -- Should -- Must We Negotiate with Evil?\": \"If a cruel dictatorship is willing to negotiate security arrangements likely to limit arms competition and make war less likely, democratic governments should engage and seek verifiable arrangements.\" So, yes, according to this logic, talk to Putin about making \"war less likely\" in eastern Ukraine and talk to him about limiting \"arms competition.\" Otherwise, shun him and everything he stands for. Opinion: Are the pro-Russian rebels terrorists? Such countries as France and Germany, which have extensive economic relations with Russia, face a difficult moral choice. They must ask themselves whether Putin is evil or evil enough. If they decide his killing spree in eastern Ukraine is neither evil nor evil enough, they must explain -- to themselves and to the rest of the world -- just why they believe the destruction of Ukrainian, Russian, Malaysian, Dutch and other lives is not a form of evil behavior. If, alternatively, Putin's behavior strikes them as evil, they must either act on that conviction, in the manner suggested above, or explain to themselves and the rest of the world just why their enhancing Putin's war-making proclivities is not wrong. Pentagon: Russia getting ready to send more powerful weapons into Ukraine . Ultimately, France and Germany, as well as all countries that aid and abet Russia's destructive capabilities, have to decide whether they care more about values or about money. Dictatorships can answer that question easily: Their leaders are indifferent to values. Prosperous capitalist democracies, and especially prosperous capitalist democracies that are part of a self-styled community of values called the European Union, cannot take the easy way out and pretend values do not matter. In the final analysis, the willingness of France, Germany and all the other states making up the European Union to respond to Putin's evil doing will determine the moral fate of the EU. If they sacrifice morality to arms contracts or gas, the EU will have lost its rasion d'etre. Worse, like Putin, it will be without a soul.",
    "summary": "Alexander Motyl says Putin has promoted, supplied Russian and pro-Russian terrorists . Motyl: Putin was member of brutal secret police and behind invasions in Georgia, Ukraine . He is evil enough for all to condemn, Motyl says; countries' silence implies approval . Motyl: France, Germany must end economic ties with Russia; EU must take a moral stand ."

    "document": "(CNN) -- Americans in two dozen states from the Midwest to the Southeast and Northeast are shivering this week courtesy of a distorted polar vortex. The rush of cold air it's sending southward is the biggest visitor from the North Pole since Santa Claus. The gifts it brings, however, are chilling and generally unwelcome. Much of the United States has plunged into a deep freeze from record low temperatures. CNN International senior meteorologist Brandon Miller answers a few pressing questions about this phenomenon. What is a polar vortex? What distinguishes it? The polar vortex, as it sounds, is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole in a counterclockwise direction -- a polar low-pressure system. These winds tend to keep the bitter cold air locked in the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is not a single storm. On occasion, this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would normally find it, allowing cold air to spill southward. How frequently does this polar vortex distortion occur? The upper-level winds that make up the polar vortex change in intensity from time to time. When those winds decrease significantly, it can allow the vortex to become distorted, and the result is a jet stream that plunges deep into southern latitudes, bringing the cold, dense Arctic air spilling down with it. This oscillation is known as the Arctic Oscillation and it can switch from a positive phase to negative phase a few times per year. This oscillation -- namely the negative phase where the polar winds are weaker -- tends to lead to major cold air outbreaks in one or more regions of the planet. Where on Earth can this happen? The polar vortex can lead to major cold air outbreaks in any portion of the Northern Hemisphere -- North America, Europe and Asia. This will lead to cold snaps in multiple locations, though not always. How dangerous is a polar vortex distortion as compared to a tornado or hurricane? Completely different type of systems. A cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread and lasts longer than a single storm. With the widespread drop in temperature, however, you can see significant winter storms develop, especially when the cold air is initially advancing into a previously warm region -- much like the nor'easter this past week. When was the last big one to hit a densely populated area? Serious cold snaps happen several times a year, though in different regions of the world and with different severities. Last March saw a significant decrease in temperature as a result of the polar vortex pushing into much of Europe. Many locations experienced an Easter holiday that was much colder than their Christmas holiday. The United Kingdom, for instance, had its coldest March in 50 years. If you get caught up in one, what should you do? Again, it's not a \"storm\" that you get caught in. But when faced with significant cold temperatures, you should stay inside whenever possible, layer clothing if you must be outside, winterize your home and car, etc. Is it a side effect of global warming and should we expect more events like this? This is a hotly researched topic. In short, yes, it could be. It seems counterintuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one, but some research shows that it could. We know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet, melting of the Arctic Sea ice, etc. This includes extreme distortions of the jet stream, which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter. Parts of Western Europe have been battered by the worst storms for two decades during the past week -- are they related to the weather system in the United States? They are related in a sense, but I wouldn't say \"caused by.\" The storms in Europe are the result of a persistent pattern that has seen the jet stream parked near the United Kingdom and Ireland, which has brought a train of storm systems over the British Isles. This is the same jet stream, of course, that has plunged deep into the southern portions of the United States. So, the jet stream has been \"stuck\" in a position that is allowing cold Arctic air to spill into much of the United States and Canada. But it is in a position that is bringing warmer, moist air from the Atlantic over Northwest Europe, resulting in the stormy conditions.",

    "document": "Within hours of the fatal fire, the behaviour of Mick and Mairead Philpott was already arousing the suspicions of the police. The couple were keen to ‘get rich quick’ off the back of the children’s deaths, receiving at least £3,100 directly in cash gifts which they used to buy new sportswear and to get drunk at parties. Mick Philpott remained shameless to the last - and he was still smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children. Scroll down for video . Philpott appeared to revel in the 'celebrity' of being the father of six dead youngsters and dabbed away non-existent tears at a press conference . Together with his wife Mairead and friend . Paul Mosley, he had plotted to set fire to the family home in an . appalling attempt to frame Philpott's former live-in lover Lisa Willis. Today the trio face sentencing for their deadly actions. Far from being an anguished father, Mick's inappropriate actions in the aftermath of the blaze made investigators suspicious. A shrine to the six dead children: Philpott tried to auction teddy bears left in memory of his children . Flowers piled high: The community left teddies outside the Philpotts' home in Victory Road, Derby. Shameless Mick wanted to sell the teddies and keep the money . The pattern of extraordinary behaviour also saw Philpott: . ■ Fake a collapse and joke around in a hospital mortuary . ■ . Sing the 1975 Elvis Presley songs Suspicious Minds and My Boy on a pub . karaoke machine and proposition a female police officer during a . ‘jovial’ visit to a hospital when he called his children ‘little sh***’ ■ Appear at a barbecue where his drunken wife showed off a new pair of £80 pink trainers. ■ . Become ‘fixated’ with creaming off the remainder of a fund to cover the . children’s funeral costs and convert it into Argos vouchers. ■ . Tell fundraisers to collect and sell teddy bears which had been left . outside the burned family home, ordering one wellwisher: ‘Shut up and . just get on with it.’ ■ Play the entire second half of a charity football match staged to raise funds for the family. Community in grief: The six dead children are carried into St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Bridgegate, Derby, as they are laid to rest . Philpott called his children 'little sh***' during a 'jovial' visit to hospital . Prosecutors wanted to tell jurors . about Philpott’s private thirst to ‘spend’ the cash or ‘get rich quick’ from it, arguing he had been presenting a ‘very different public . face’. But the evidence was ruled inadmissible. The deadly gamble was to save the six . youngsters, blame Miss Willis, and win back custody of five children who . had recently moved out of the cramped three-bedroom semi with her. Yesterday Mick, Mairead and Mosley were found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court. The former live-in lover who Mick Philpott tried to frame for the . fatal fire in a bitter custody battle is 'happy for the first time in . years', it was revealed today. Lisa Willis, who had five children with the killer, left the house . she shared with him and his wife Mairead in a bizarre love triangle in . February last year. But when took the children with her, Philpott hatched a despicable plot to start a fire at his house and blame her. She was arrested the day after the blaze which killed six of his other children, but was released within hours. A source told The Sun: 'She has escaped the nightmare that was living with Philpott and Mairead. 'She is now a new woman, happy for the first time in years.' Assistant . Chief Constable Steve Cotterill, of Derbyshire Police, said after . yesterday's verdict: 'We decided at a very early stage Lisa Willis was . not involved.' Philpott, 56, shouted obscenities before saying ‘it’s not over yet’ moments after Mrs Justice Thirlwall asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘out of respect for the memories’ of the children he had killed. But with typical arrogance, Philpott, who infamously appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to demand a bigger council house, crossed himself, waved and smiled as he was led away. On May 11 last year, after Philpott had a sordid sex session with his wife and Mosley on their home snooker table, the fire was lit, with the intention that the six children sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window, with Philpott both ‘the hero and the victim’. But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong. Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F. Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, all died of smoke inhalation. Detectives . started to take a firm interest in Mick soon as they began receiving witness . statements which cast doubt on Philpott’s claim to have made repeated . attempts to reach his children. While some heroic and soot-covered neighbours needed medical attention . following their attempts to reach the six trapped children, Philpott . appeared ‘spotlessly clean’. He . was spotted wandering off from his 32-year-old wife and other relatives . at the Royal Derby Hospital for a 30-minute discussion with his friend Mosley. He even had to . be persuaded by police to travel with his dying stepson Duwayne, 13, . when it was decided to transfer the teenager to Birmingham Children’s . Hospital. Devastation: The Philpott's burnt out home in Victory Road, Derby, after the fire which killed the six children . Gutted: The blackened bathroom after the fire ripped through the home. Mick Philpott and Mairead Philpott was found guilty of manslaughter and starting the blaze yesterday . Mick and Mairead Philpott wanted to 'get rich quick' off the back of their six children's deaths . He died there three days later. Duwayne’s . godmother Jeannie Donnan said that in the hospital canteen ‘they would . all sit quiet and then all of a sudden they’d all start a food fight and . I was like, how can you have a food fight? You have just lost six kids … . I was just sitting there thinking “no, this is not right”.’ By the time of a press conference five days after the blaze, he and his wife were already under deep suspicion. Philpott . called the conference himself, ostensibly to thank the emergency . services for their efforts to save his children. He appeared to be . revelling in the ‘celebrity’ of being the father of six dead youngsters. During the trial, the court heard how Philpott lived with . his wife, Miss Willis and their combined 11 children in his cramped . three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby. But he was left irate after Miss Willis, 29, became disillusioned with his ‘domineering behaviour’ and summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her five children early last year.

    "document": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's High Court ordered the immediate release Tuesday of six former army officers accused of plotting to topple President Robert Mugabe. The alleged coup plotters have been in prison since 2007, despite several attempts by their lawyers to have them released. Treason carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe. After reading a seven-page ruling, Justice Yunus Omerjee said it was apparent that the defendants should not have been commuted to custody and he said a declaratory order will be issued to that effect. Justice Joseph Musakwa concurred. In July, the High Court dismissed the case because the alleged coup plotters had not been brought to court for trial within six months, as required by law. State prosecutors responded by re-indicting them. The defendants appealed to the High Court to throw out the re-indictment. The man accused of being the ringleader of the alleged coup plot, Albert Matapo, was arrested in 2007, as were six other suspects: Nyasha Zivuku, Oncemore Mazivahona, Emmanuel Marara, Patson Mupfure, Shingirai Mutemachani and Rangarirai Maziofa. They were accused of plotting to violently topple Mugabe and replace him with the country's defense minister, Emerson Mnangagwa. The suspects denied the allegations against them, and one was later released. Their attorneys said if the state wished to pursue the matter, their clients would not be detained. It was not immediately clear what action the state would take.",

    "document": "A former salesman is facing eviction from his home after his problem with hoarding spiralled out of control. Brian Clenshaw, 52, has filled his flat to the brim with thousands of newspapers, magazines, DVDs, books, coins and stamps. Now his landlord has taken court action to have him thrown out of his house in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, because the clutter presents 'a fire hazard'. Obsessive: Brian Clenshaw has collected thousands of books, DVDs, magazines and coins . Brian believes he suffers from Obsessive Hoarding Syndrome and his condition means he and cannot throw anything away. He says his obsession to keep everything became uncontrollable after the stress of a serious road accident. His landlord A.E.Chattell & Sons has now been granted a ruling by Tunbridge Wells County Court to order Brian to leave. Brian said today he has 'begged for help' with his hoarding problem but has yet to find any support. He said: 'Ever since I was a little boy I was a bit of a hoarder. And I have always been a bit insecure. 'But it was always manageable. It was silly but manageable. But I had a bad accident back in 1997 where I was run over by a ten tonne lorry and I started struggling. 'In 2004 that is when the hoarding took off I was buying all sorts of things from Amazon, book shops you name it - books, DVDs, CDs. 'I started a serious coin collection. I was spending hundreds and hundred of pounds on coins. Still collecting stamps which I have done quite seriously since 1994, but the coins were a new one. 'I had a GP came round in February 2009 to try and sort things out about how we are going to move on for me and the sofa was clear. 'So it has absolutely mushroomed over the last two or three years. I believe it is a subset of OCD called Compulsive Hoarding Syndrome. 'I have been not diagnosed with this but clearly that is something I have got. Facing eviction: Brian Clenshaw faces being homeless this Christmas after his landlord took legal action to have him evicted . 'Daunting': Mr Clenshaw says he is apprehensive about having to find a new home after being told he is being evicted by his landlord . 'It is very, very daunting I accept that the newspapers and magazines have to go, but a lot of my stuff is decent stuff - reference books, coins, stamps, got my bicycle, golf clubs, CD, you name it. 'I cannot just put that in a holdall rucksack. At least I have now got a week hopefully to try and sort out the important things and more importantly find somewhere else to live.\" Friend Tim Burchill, 44, a researcher, said Brian is 'absolutely terrified' of being thrown out on to the streets. He said: 'Everyone has just turned their backs on him - even his family. I just want to give him the support and understanding he deserves. 'Brian recognised he had a problem with hoarding and had started clearing up. But when the agent started taking him to court he felt under pressure and the stress caused him to start again. 'If the letting agent just gave him sixth months more to stay in the flat he would get everything back on track. 'I am working with him to get an official diagnosis of Obsessive Hoarding Syndrome.' Brian has until December 12 to find a new place to live but he says he has little movement left in his pelvis after his accident which makes it difficult to lift things. He has hundreds of newspapers including copies of the Times and Daily Mail as well as stacks of glossy magazines like Maxim. And he has huge piles of DVDs including the BBC Olympics DVD as well as the moretraditional collectors items coins and stamps. Problem: Mr Clenshaw says his hoarding problem got worse after a serious accident . In need of help: Mr Clenshaw says he has had a problem with hoarding since he was a boy but it got worse after he suffered a serious road accident . A spokeswoman for A.E.Chattell & Sons said they took court action as a 'last resort' and added the council has some emergency accommodation available. She said: 'We have embarked on the court process to regain possession from Brian's flat as an absolute last resort. 'There are tenancy issues that Brian is aware of. There are large quantities of stored newspapers and magazines in Brian's flat and these present a significant fire hazard. 'We have offered to clear the flat, but to no avail. We have tried to ensure alternative accommodation he available for Brian and we are in contact with the council housing department and a mental health charity. 'We understand from the council that emergency accommodation is available for Brian.'",

About 80 percent of people voting in the Oakland election approved the new medical marijuana tax. About 80 percent of voters chose to impose the tax on Oakland's medical marijuana facilities, according to the Alameda County Registrar of Voters. Some celebrated the news at Oaksterdam University by hand-rolling large marijuana cigarettes or stuffing cannabis into pipes. The school trains students for work in the medical marijuana industry. \"It is important because the city of Oakland is facing a massive deficit like many jurisdictions in California,\" said Steve DeAngelo, a leader of one of the city's cannabis clubs. \"And we decided to step up to the plate and make a contribution to the city in a time of need.\" DeAngelo, one of the people who led the effort to get the tax approved, said his business will now have to pay more than $350,000 from the new tax next year. Watch report from CNN's Dan Simon » . Oakland's City Council was also behind the move. \"Given that the medical cannabis dispensaries are something that was legalized in California, why not have revenue from it?\" said councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan. There was no formal opposition to the effort, but some drug fighters say the tax sends the wrong message. \"The taxation of a federally unlawful drug is just not something that the community should accept,\" said Paul Chabot of the Coalition for a Drug Free California. \"With the state in dire straits in finances and the country looking for ways to pay down debt, looking at illegal drugs is the absolute wrong thing to do.\" The measure, passed in special mail-in election Tuesday, imposes a 1.8 percent gross receipts tax on the four licensed medical cannabis dispensaries in Oakland. These facilities would have to pay about $18 in taxes for every 1,000 in marijuana sales. CNN's Dan Simon contributed to this report.",

The American public trusts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to handle dangerous biological materials, but recent incidents have put a damper on the agency's reputation, members of Congress said Wednesday. \"What happened was completely unacceptable,\" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in his testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee for Oversight and Investigations. \"It never should have happened.\" Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, the subcommittee chairman, opened the hearing by summarizing the troubling incidents that have come to light over the past month. In early June, dozens of CDC workers were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to inactivate the dangerous bacteria before transferring it to a lower lab. A subsequent investigation revealed \"an alarming series of failures,\" according to one of the subcommittee members, including an incident of cross contamination between a relatively safe and a potentially deadly strain of the flu virus. An outside investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found dangerous biological materials stored in unlocked refrigerators and a general lack of lab workers following safety protocols. Investigators say the anthrax that was believed to be deactivated was transferred in Ziploc bags, which are obviously not approved to carry such materials. \"This is troubling, and it is completely unacceptable,\" Murphy said. \"The CDC is supposed to be the gold standard (for lab safety). ...This is not sound science, and this will not be tolerated. These practices put the health of the American public at risk.\" Murphy said the CDC was lucky that no one appears to have been infected during the anthrax incident, but \"sooner or later that luck will run out.\" This is not the first time the subcommittee has heard of safety issues at CDC labs, said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado. Multiple hearings over the past decade have shown lapses that together reveal a problem with safety reporting at the agency, she said. \"What we all need to know is the plan to change the culture at the CDC,\" DeGette said. \"We can do a lot but we can't legislate a culture change.\" Frieden, who took the CDC director job in 2009, acknowledged that he and other CDC managers failed to recognize a \"critical pattern.\" The CDC has closed the labs that were involved in the incidents. They won't reopen until better safety procedures are in place, Frieden said. Scientists have also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest-level labs while their procedures are being re-evaluated. This may slow some CDC processes -- such as providing materials for companies to create next year's flu vaccine, Frieden said -- but safety comes first. \"We must do that work more safely, and we will,\" he said.",

    "document": "One of Labour’s brightest rising stars has challenged Ed Miliband’s position on the private sector providing free NHS services, declaring: ‘What matters is what works’. Liz Kendall, a Blairite shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader, struck a markedly different tone on NHS ‘privatisation’ to Mr Miliband and her immediate boss, Andy Burnham. She also warned against Labour becoming ‘the moaning man in the pub’ and defended middle class voters with ‘sharp elbows’ who demand the best from public services. Liz Kendall, a Blairite shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader, struck a markedly different tone on NHS ‘privatisation’ to Mr Miliband and her immediate boss, Andy Burnham . Mr Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of NHS services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under Labour. Mr Burnham, meanwhile, has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the Government wants to let ‘the market… carry on ripping through the NHS’. The shadow health secretary has also insisted ‘the NHS as we know it won’t exist’ if the Conservatives remain in power. But Miss Kendall, in an interview with political magazine The House, insisted: ‘There will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenges to the system. 'I believe what matters is what works. That’s what I’ve always believed in and I continue to believe in.’ She praised the privately-run independent treatment centres (ITSCs) first created by Tony Blair’s government, while she was an adviser in the Department of Health, which were credited with helping to cut NHS waiting times. Ed Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of NHS services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under Labour . ‘I remember when I worked in the Department of Health a very senior clinician saying “you’ve got one of these ISTCs down the road now so I’m going to have to talk to some of my GP colleagues about getting my waits down and stop doing so much private practice”. ‘So it did bring challenge to the system. It was the NHS – and the increased investment we put in the NHS – that delivered the vast majority of the reductions in the waits. But some challenge in the system was crucial to that. ‘I think we need real reforms of our public services, including the NHS and social care, in many different areas.’ She backed the idea of medical consultations by Skype and iPhone, insisting: ‘It is a disgrace how little we have used technology to transform people’s experience. Andy Burnham has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the Government wants to let ‘the market… carry on ripping through the NHS’ 'This [she points to her iPhone] is part of my life now and that is how people increasingly expect to interact with the NHS. ‘Some people think “oh, it’s just some pushy middle class people wanting to get things from their doctor when and where they want”. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making sure that our NHS needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else.’ Miss Kendall also suggested Labour needed to demonstrate how it would reform public services in an age of austerity. ‘Without doubt, post-financial crash, and the constraints in public spending that there rightfully has to be, it was very clear that the NHS needs to contribute to that as a whole,’ she said. ‘On the left we do have to show how we can deliver our goals of social justice and fairness when there’s less money around. But also because we need to make services work better for people.’ Asked whether she wanted to be Labour leader, the shadow minister said: ‘If anyone says anything nice about me it’s incredibly flattering. All I care about is winning on May 7. All I care about is getting Ed [Miliband] into Downing Street, full stop. That’s it.’ Labour has made the NHS central to its election campaign, issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’ and claiming that public spending would be cut back to 1930s levels. Tory MPs accuse the party of hypocrisy and shroud-waving, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when Labour was in power. Overall, only around just six pence in every pound is spent in the NHS with the private sector, compared to around five pence under Labour.",

Andre Smith (pictured), 25, attacked Rachel Kane, 25, at her home in Kidderminster, Worcs, with such ferocity that he broke two knives during the assault . A jilted lover who stabbed his ex-girlfriend six times in the stomach while she was heavily pregnant has been jailed today for 15 years. Andre Smith, 25, attacked Rachel Kane, also 25, at her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, with such ferocity that he broke two knives during the assault. Ms Kane, who was seven months pregnant, suffered lacerations to her uterus and liver and a perforated bowel during the attack. She was taken into intensive care where she went into labour, despite efforts by doctors to halt the premature birth. Not only did Ms Kane survive the assault but she also gave birth to a healthy daughter, who was born three months early. Worcester Crown Court heard Smith went to Ms Kane’s home at around 11pm on July 28, armed with a plasterer’s knife. He forced his way in and attacked her in front of her other child in the hall before dragging her into the kitchen where he stabbed her with a second knife. Smith fled the scene but was arrested in nearby Hagley a short time later after phoning the police to turn himself in. The court heard Smith, from Great Barr, Birmingham, had targeted Ms Kane four years after the pair split up. At the time of the attack, she had been on the phone to her new partner - who dialled 999 after he heard her screams. Judge Robert Juckes jailed Smith for 15 years after he pleaded guilty to attempted murder. He ordered Smith to serve at least ten years before he is considered for parole. A second charge of attempted child destruction was ordered to lie on file. Ms Kane, who was seven months pregnant, suffered lacerations to her uterus and liver and a perforated bowel during the attack. Not only did Ms Kane survive the assault but she also gave birth to a healthy daughter, who was born three months early. (Posed by model) Speaking after the verdict, DI David Williams of West Mercia Police welcomed the sentence and branded Smith ‘dangerous’. He said: 'Smith is clearly a very dangerous individual who attacked his former partner with the clear intention to kill the unborn child she was having with a new partner. 'The majority of stab wounds were to her abdomen and it is only the swift reaction of neighbours and her partner, and the prompt medical attention she received, that saved her life and that of her baby. 'Although the child was born a week later and was very premature, it has thankfully pulled through. 'This was a horrific case but the police officers on duty that night and in the following days displayed excellent teamwork and dedication in carrying out a speedy arrest and gathering enough evidence to ensure Smith could be kept in custody. 'The lengthy jail sentence handed down by the court reflects severity of the attack and we hope it brings some comfort to the victim and her family.'",

    "document": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Tyrese Gibson is far from the first singer to make the transition from music to movies. However, the \"Transformers\" star is blazing a whole new trail with his latest crossover venture. Tyrese Gibson voices \"Mayhem,\" a hero described as the \"embodiment of raw justice and vengeance.\" The actor/singer/model has partnered with Apple to develop his own comic book series called \"Mayhem,\" and he's doing it in a very nontraditional way -- digitally. \"There was an experience that I felt was pretty limiting as far as the comic book experience itself on paper,\" says Gibson, who stresses that he did not grow up reading comic books and is not a comic book veteran. \"[So] I set up this technology with my team and this is the first-ever digital comic book [on iTunes] in the history of comic books.\" The third issue of \"Mayhem,\" which is downloadable from iTunes, is the first to go digital. It features an interactive version of a comic book with sound effects, page turns and even voiceover. Gibson himself voices the title character, a masked, dagger-hurling hero described as the \"embodiment of raw justice and vengeance.\" Gibson's new hobby is another example of Hollywood's love affair with comic books. Just last month, Walt Disney Studios acquired Marvel Entertainment -- and all 5,000 of the comic book company's characters -- for $4 billion in cash and stock. With the success of action films based on comic book notables, including \"Batman,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Wolverine,\" it's not a stretch to think that Gibson might be strapping on the \"Mayhem\" costume for a summer blockbuster in the future. But for now, Gibson is focused on the early stages of his new venture. Although he would not provide details on sales figures, he did say that worldwide sales of \"Mayhem\" would \"knock your socks off.\" The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What turned you on to comic books? Tyrese Gibson: I went out to Comic-Con about a year or so ago to promote the film \"Death Race.\" When I was out there, I really got to know some of the fans and I was just asking questions like, \"Look at you, you've got a full on Superman costume on or Batman costume,\" and they were just like, \"I just love comic books.\" It was the first time I was ever exposed to that much selfless passion, to the point to where you don't care how silly you may look -- you don't even consider it silly. ... That really did something for me, because I'm motivated by passion. I thought ... I want to figure a way to be a part of this world, and that's when \"Mayhem\" was born.\" CNN: Where did the story of \"Mayhem\" come from? Gibson: Me and my partner Mike Lee and Will Wilson all got together, we started brainstorming about different concepts and different directions we could send this character in and we came up with something pretty unique. It's an ongoing series and so as soon as you think you've got it figured out, there's a cliffhanger that makes you want to read the second issue and the third issue. CNN: You're a newcomer to this genre. What's been the feedback from the comic book community? Gibson: In everything you do, there's gonna be cynics and those folks questioning what your motivation is behind getting into anything. I dealt with it when I went from one career move to the next: \"Man, stick to singing; stick to acting.\" I dealt with a lot of that from certain folks in the comic book world. ... They wrote these long e-mails and [started] on a smear campaign. I came into this whole thing very innocent. I discovered my love for comic books and I want as many people as possible to experience my comic book. There's this digital revolution that's out there but the comic book world has not embraced this digital revolution on a level that it should be embraced on. And so I reached out to my contacts and I set up a meeting ... and this is my baby. CNN: Artist Jim Lee is very big in the comic book world. How did he get involved in this project? Gibson: I found Jim Lee on Twitter ... and we just kind of took it from there. CNN: What did you learn from him? Gibson: So much, so much. He basically made me aware of all of the big players in the comic world like Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. He just painted this picture about who's who in the comic book world and he schooled me on that level. CNN: A lot of comic book characters become heroes on the big screen. Does \"Mayhem\" have a future in film? Gibson: Right now, there is no conversation on any level about \"Mayhem\" becoming a film. We've been approached a few times but my mind state is this: You can't expect to sell out the Staples Center until you sell a bunch of records. So we're really trying to establish the fan base for \"Mayhem\" before we try to turn it into film. There's still plenty of time for that.",

    "document": "(CNN) -- West Virginia has demanded a full list of any other chemicals that might have leaked from a Charleston-area storage plant after its owners revealed another compound had spilled into the Elk River. The state Department of Environmental Protection gave Freedom Industries until Wednesday afternoon to disclose \"any and all information\" related to the January 9 spill. The move came a day after the company told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank, a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers, known as PPH -- was part of the leak. PPH is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of Charleston, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law. \"These materials were not included in the initial information regarding the composition of the spilled materials,\" the agency stated in a Wednesday order to Freedom. In a statement issued along with the order, DEP chief Randy Huffman called the late disclosure \"completely unacceptable.\" More than 7,000 gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM, leaked into Charleston's water supply after it leaked out of a Freedom Industries storage tank. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water, some for more than a week. The CDC said little is known about the health hazards of PPH, but it appears to be less toxic than MCHM and made up about 5% of the total volume of the leaking tank. \"Given the small percentage of PPH in the tank and information suggesting similar water solubility as MCHM, it is likely that any amount of PPH currently in the water system would be extremely low,\" it said. \"However, the water system has not been tested for this material.\" Faced with numerous lawsuits as a result of the spill, Freedom Industries filed for bankruptcy protection last week. The company had no immediate response to Wednesday's demand from state officials, who have pledged to step up their oversight of the industry.",

Rodgers, who today guided the Reds to victory over Norwich and a step closer to the club's first league title in 24 years, was at the Birkdale, Southport, home of Charlotte Hind, 31, the former travel coordinator of the club, when the man pulled up in his car and began honking his horn and hurling abuse. Mr Rodgers, 41, told the man, believed to be in his early 20s, to leave, but he instead started swearing and shouting for Rodgers to come into the street, before grabbing the bat from his car and attacking the front door.

Police were called by neighbours . He then jumped back in his car and left. Neighbours called the police and three squad cars arrive, but the man was gone by the time they arrived. The shocking incident took place on Monday afternoon. Yesterday a source told The Sunday Mirror: 'Thankfully Brendan has put this behind him and focused on football.' A neighbour added: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn. 'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.' The damage to the front door of the home is visible in this picture . Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football. Rodgers has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat. The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training ground.

    "document": "(Oprah.com) -- In 1986 Susan King hit her head -- hard -- in a car accident. The result was more than a concussion. Afterward, when King looked at people, she saw images of events occurring in their lives and had flashes of insight about them. With uncanny knowledge of their situations, she has been able to advise clients on everything from job searches to divorce proceedings. King refers to her work as intuitive counseling, and though her vocation may seem rarefied, she believes that intuitive power is available to everyone. \"To me it's our body's radar, helping us make all sorts of decisions -- if only we're willing to pay attention.\" Oprah.com: 10 questions that have no right to go away . My intuition has gone through a metamorphosis from the time I was a young child to where I am now. I used to just get feelings. I went from getting feelings to having dreams, to seeing symbols that meant things, to seeing things actually happening to other people, to feeling that what's happening to other people is happening to me. Intuition is knowing without knowing. It's instinctively knowing something that you don't know how you know. You meet people and you have a subconscious feeling: You like them or not. You trust them or you don't. And sometimes you stop and think, Where does that come from? What is that? Oprah.com: When to trust your gut . I believe that just as we hear and see and smell and taste, this is another sense we have, but it's one we don't recognize. I think it's almost an animal sense that we've forgotten. We were better at intuition in the past. With modern technology and the frantic pace of life, most people today spend their lives running. Never stopping to listen. There's no time for the mind to be quiet to listen to anything. And then when a problem comes: trauma. Because people are not in touch with themselves at all. You have to incorporate in your day some quiet time to listen to that voice. If you don't, you won't hear it. But it's there. It's meant to guide us. Oprah.com: Are you listening to your life? If you were to go out and meet somebody, spend an hour with them, and there was an attraction, and you came back home and wrote down the first thing you felt when you saw them, when they spoke to you, when they touched your shoulder -- you may not realize it, but you'd find that you'd already built a subconscious profile of the person. We all have that capability, but we don't use it. I'll tell you a group who uses intuition: people who do martial arts. They have to anticipate what their opponent's going to do. Remember Bruce Lee? Even people coming from behind, he could see. It's like he had eyes in the back of his head. There are times when you get a feeling about something -- say, I don't want to get on this flight -- and you wonder: Is it my anxiety, or is it real? It's difficult to know what's fact or fiction. You can only judge over a period of time. You have to gain confidence in your ability to listen. Number one, you can build up to 15 minutes a day of sitting and focusing on your breathing. So that you have quiet time to connect with your inner self. Oprah.com: 7 ways to reduce your stress from Dr. Oz . Number two, every day, live the day and enjoy the day. Don't be anxious about, Is this gonna happen or is that gonna happen? Walk through your day -- don't run. Get a little notebook, a tiny thing that fits in your pocket. When you have a feeling about something, write it down. That way, when your feeling later turns out to have been correct, you can go back and see that your instincts were working. And that builds your confidence. Intuition is like a muscle. You develop it the more you use it. One of the worst things in life is indecision and confusion. It plagues everybody. But confusion is sometimes a blessing when it stops you from making a move, because sometimes you're not supposed to make a move. I say to people, \"You don't walk down stairs blindfolded, you don't drive a car blindfolded -- why would you want to make massive life-changing decisions when you can't see what you're doing? You have to wait for clarity.\" So to me, confusion can be a kind of intuition: your body's way of saying, don't do anything right now -- just go with the flow and the answer will come. I've given lots of talks, to all kinds of groups, and sometimes you'll get people -- usually men -- who will say, \"I think it's a load of old rubbish.\" And I'll say, \"Well, that's your belief. I'm not here to change your belief.\" The most important thing is just to trust it. Trust in your gut. Trust that first feeling you feel about something. Because that very first feeling is usually the right one. Oprah.com: The gut whisperer: 3 exercises to help you tune in . --As told to Susan Casey .

The recordings, which were made public by the Pima County Sheriff's Office on Sunday, paint a patchy picture of the scene just moments after the shooting that killed six people and wounded 14, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Callers spoke with remarkable clarity given the chaos around them. Screams can be heard in the background as one male caller calmly tells another man, \"We got help coming.\" The following information has been edited for brevity and to protect the names of the callers. Not all calls are included. 911: 911, where is your emergency? Caller 1: Mrs. Giffords! 911: Hello? Hello? Caller 1: Oh, 911. There was a shooting at Safeway ... where Gabrielle Giffords was. And I do believe Gabrielle Giffords was hit. 911: At Safeway, sir? Caller 1: Yeah, Safeway. 911: Was somebody shot then sir? Caller 1: Yes, it looked like the guy had a semiautomatic pistol and he went in. He just started firing. And then he ran. 911: Which way did he run? Caller 1: He ran north past the Walgreens that's right next to the Safeway. 911: Can you describe him? Caller 1: He was wearing a hoodie. 911: What color was the hoodie? Caller 1: It was black. 911: What color were his pants? Caller 1: It looked like he was wearing blue jeans. And he was wearing a black sweater. 911: Is anybody injured? Did you say Gabrielle Giffords was hit? Caller 1: She's hit. I do believe she's breathing. She was breathing. She still has a pulse ... And we got one dead. 911: And there's other people that are injured? Caller 1: There was multiple people shot. 911: Oh my God. 911: 911, are you reporting a shooting? Caller 2: Yes, I am. 911: OK, did you witness anything? Caller 2: Yes I did. 911: What did you witness ma'am? Caller 2: I witnessed ... gunshot and then I tried to duck down. I see the man that was caught shooting was held down by some other people. They took away his gun and they're holding him down so he can't do anything else. 911: OK, we do have deputies on the way. They'll be there shortly. I need you to stay out of the way where you're at right now and try to get anyone else to safety without getting yourself in any harm, OK? Caller 2: OK, yeah. I'm in the Walgreens in the back so that way I feel like I'm a little more safe. 911: OK, well we have deputies on the way.

    "document": "The Caño Cristales river in Colombia is regarded by many as the most beautiful in the world. Known as the 'liquid rainbow,' the spectacular waters are turned into a kaleidoscope of colour thanks to freshwater plants known as macarenia clavigera and endemic to the Sierra de la Macarena, a mountain range south of the capital Bogota. During the short time between the wet and dry season, July to November, along with moss, aquatic plants and corals, the red plants cling to rocks throughout the 62-mile long river, and help create a fusion of colours just under the surface of the water. Scroll down for video . Pits have been created along the length of the river that the macarenia clavigera plants cling to creating a beautiful sight . A fusion of five colours are created by a mix of plants clashing with the grey rocks and the crystal blue waters . Tourists flock to the witness the display in season, with the crystal clear water showing the wildlife under the surface as well as the beautiful plants. Green, blue, black, red and yellow are all very visible during the season and locals say the best time to see the plants at their brightest is just after a storm, when the colours appear at their most vivid. The geological formation of the river is rich with sediment, and the rocks are some 1.2 billion years old. This, combined with the different-coloured plantation helps create the prism of colour. But for half the year, the river is much like any other; the bed of rocks creating a shimmering grey colour, with the odd splashes of green moss along the way. Looking like something from a pre-historic age, the colours of the plants almost make the water appear blood red . Tourists were warned from travelling to the Caño Cristales prior to 2009 due to terrorism and threats of damaging the environment . However, the Caño Cristales is not accessible by road; instead tourists will have to fly into La Macarena, then organise a short transfer to the Serrania de la Macarena National Park, where they can then make the last part of the journey by foot or on horseback. The Caño Cristales season runs from mid May to the start of December. It is not possible to book tours outside of these dates. The site was only re-opened to tourists in 2009 after years of terrorist activity, as well as the perceived threat of humans damaging the natural environment. There are also other important waterfalls such as Angostura I in the Guayabero and Caño Cafre rivers, surrounded by rocky edges with a great amount of 'petroglifos' (rock engravings), making the national park a sight to behold. You almost can't believe this is a river - but the Caño Cristales stretches over 60 miles and is wonderous in colours . The macarenia clavigera, left, is indigenous to the area of the macarenia clavigera, and right, the sunshine shows off the beauty . The clean and clear waters offer tourists the chance to discover just what causes such a fusion of colours in the Caño Cristales .",

    "document": "(CNN)There is no evidence that anyone at the NFL saw or possessed a video showing Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée until it was made public, but the league should have known it needed to dig deeper into the incident, an external investigative report released Thursday concludes. The report wraps up an inquiry by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into how the NFL initially investigated the then-Baltimore Ravens running back's attack on Janay Palmer last February at the Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. \"We concluded there was substantial information about the incident -- even without the in-elevator video -- indicating the need for a more thorough investigation,\" Mueller said in his report. \"The NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident.\" The NFL asked for Mueller's report in September after a public outcry over NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's handling of Rice's discipline. \"While this investigation has now concluded, our focus on the underlying issues and our commitment to positive change remain as strong as ever,\" Goodell said in a written statement. \"We have all learned a great deal in the past months and expect to be judged by how we lead going forward on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault.\" Here are some things we learned through the report: . No evidence of video at NFL office . In September, The Associated Press reported that a law enforcement official told one of its reporters that the source mailed a copy of a video from a surveillance camera inside an elevator at the now closed Revel casino showing Rice knocking out Palmer to a league executive in April. The report said a woman called from a league phone number to acknowledge receipt of the video. The report says more than 200 league employees were interviewed and found no evidence that happened. Among the employees questioned were the women whose ID badges indicated they were in the NFL office on April 9. All 188 said they made no phone call. \"Each denied having seen the in-elevator video or even hearing a rumor that an in-elevator video of the Rice incident had been received by the league before it appeared on (celebrity news website) TMZ on September 8,\" investigators said. Also questioned were people in the mailroom, and no one there could remember a package sent to Jeff Miller, the league's senior vice president of security. Multiple emails from high-level NFL executives indicate they had not seen the video before it was posted on TMZ, the report says. Ray Rice's attorney had copy of video on April 1 . The prosecutor's office in Atlantic County wanted to wait until after a grand jury heard the case in late March before releasing the video to Michael Diamondstein, Rice's attorney. Diamondstein had asked for a copy from the casino on February 20. He was told by the casino's lawyer that police said not to turn over any evidence while an investigation was ongoing. Later Diamondstein was referred to the prosecutor. Rice was indicted on March 27 on a third-degree aggravated assault charge. His lawyer received a copy of the video from the casino on April 1 and from the prosecutor days later as part of the process of discovery. The report says Diamondstein chatted about the video with Ravens President Richard Cass and the lawyer said it was \"terrible.\" The two disagree precisely when the call took place and how much of what was on the video was discussed. Diamondstein told investigators that if the league had asked for a copy of the video, he would have provided it. That was one of the league's missteps identified in the report. Others included not contacting police officers who investigated the incident, not attempting to get videos from the casino or the prosecutors, and not following up with the Ravens to see if the team had information the league did not. \"Had the league undertaken a more substantial investigation, it may have gathered available information about the incident, possibly including the in-elevator video prior to its public release,\" the report says. Atlantic City Police called NFL in March . A private investigator who was working the case for the NFL had been in touch with the Atlantic City Police Department trying to get the arrest report and other documents. He was told twice the police wouldn't provide the information. He asked a supervisor in the records division, Ava Davenport, if he could get reports if he filed an Open Public Records Act request. She said everything in it would be redacted. On March 28, the day after Rice's indictment, someone using Davenport's work phone called the NFL office and spoke to an operator for 59 seconds. Police declined to discuss the nature of the call and the operator couldn't remember what was discussed. The call wasn't transferred, records showed. The incident was viewed live . A security officer at the casino watched Rice strike Palmer twice as it happened on a surveillance monitor. That employee called another security officer to the elevator. When a supervisor arrived Palmer couldn't remember what had happened. Two DVD copies of surveillance video were given to police that morning. The in-house copy of video was viewable by security workers for several days before access was restricted. One employee told Mueller's team as many as 40 people had access to the room where the video could be watched. Mueller calls investigation independent . Several media reports had called into question Mueller as lead investigator because his law firm has done work for the NFL. But Mueller writes he has never provided legal services to the league nor has any of his team. Mueller said he joined the WilmerHale firm in March 2014, years after the firm helped the league negotiate with two media groups. In the past four years, the firm has only provided advice on immigration issues. \"Placing these relationships in context, I am quite confident that the ties described above have in no way influenced the conduct of this investigation,\" he says. Recommendations . Mueller says: \"Our findings demonstrate the weaknesses inherent in the league's longstanding practice of deferring to the criminal justice system with respect to the investigation of facts and the imposition of discipline under the Personal Conduct Policy. Discipline should be imposed on the basis of the specific nature of the player's conduct, not solely or necessarily on the disposition of a criminal case.\" He recommend the NFL establish an investigative team for domestic violence and sexual assault cases, that the league expand its security department with a special counsel and other personnel, and clarify policies that assured teams the league shared information. \"Investigations of domestic violence cases present unique challenges,\" the report says.",

'Everybody was yelling to jump in the water, and it just started snowballing,' Ron Darro said. 'More and more people were in the water.' Faced with the footage after the fact, Montoya looked as if he was about to cry.

Mr Cameron arrived at the White House late last night after having spent his first day in Washington meeting with Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Obama greeted him in the Oval Office before the two walked together into the presidential residence to begin their discussions. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Barack Obama make their way from the Oval Office to the Residence to begin their working dinner . The pair appeared to be in good spirits as they chatted before settling down to business . Mr Cameron and Mr Obama are pictured inside the Oval Office moments after the Prime Minister was invited inside . It was revealed today a cyber cell of British and American intelligence and security agents is being created to defeat online attacks in an 'unprecedented' deal to be struck by Mr Cameron and the President. Mr Obama is toughening up the American response in the wake of the embarrassing and damaging North Korean hack on Sony Pictures and the infiltration of Pentagon Twitter and YouTube sites. Ahead of tonight's working dinner, Mr Cameron warned of the increasing threat of cyber attacks. 'This is an evolving threat which poses a real risk to our businesses and that's why we're taking our cooperation with the US to an unprecedented level. This is about pooling our effort so we stay one step ahead of those who seek to attack us. The leaders' discussions were undertaken last night during a 'working dinner'. Judging by the menu, it looks to have been one of Mr Cameron's more enjoyable duties. 'The joint exercises and training of our next generation of cyber experts will help to ensure that we have the capability we need to protect critical sectors like our energy, transport and financial infrastructure from emerging threats.' Under the plans GCHQ and MI5 will join forces with NSA and FBI to turn an American cyber cell into a transatlantic operation, to improve information sharing about threats. The Prime Minister's two-day trip to Washington appears to have started well - earlier in the day Miss Lagarde lavished him with praise for Britain's role in leading the world in economic growth. However, their leaders' meeting comes amid heightened fears about terrorism in Europe and the West after last week's terrorist attacks in France, in which 17 people were slain. Cyber-terrorism and surveillance will be central issues at the visit, which Tory strategists hope will be a pre-election ‘love-in’ between Mr Cameron and Mr Obama and boost the Prime Minister’s standing at home. Unusually, the President has agreed to host Mr Cameron close to an election, apparently repaying the favour Mr Cameron made by visiting the US and all but endorsing him during the last presidential race.",

    "document": "By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . Loss: James Embry, 57, passed away in prison following a hunger strike - but his family was not told . Relatives of a man who died of a hunger strike in prison and was buried in a pauper's grave have revealed the devastating moment they learned of his death in the newspaper. James Kenneth Embry, who had been in and out of prison after struggling with alcohol and drug abuse and mental health issues, died after a five-week hunger strike at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville in January. After his death, prison officials said no family had visited him in prison or claimed his remains and he had been buried in a pauper's grave. It wasn't until his step-daughter Hope Keown - who described Embry as a fantastic father before he vanished from their lives - read an article while sat in her kitchen that she learned of his death. 'We didn't even know he was back in prison,' Keown, 35, told the Associated Press. She . and her mother, 58-year-old Mae Embry of Owensboro, Kentucky, didn't . believe what they were reading at first, then broke into tears as the . reality set in. They struggled to tell other relatives. 'Kenny . was very strong willed so it breaks my heart that he resorted to . starving himself,' Keown said. 'I think he wanted to live the good life . and be a family man. He just didn't know how to shake his demons.' Embry's hunger strike had included a nine-day stretch in which he . lost 32 pounds from his six-foot frame, dropping down to just 138 . pounds. He eventually died from dehydration and starvation. Scene: Officials at the Kentucky State Penitentiary said that no relatives had visited him in prison or claimed his remains, so his body was buried in a pauper's grave. His family learned of his death in a news article . It came after Embry was hit with a nine-year term for multiple drug crimes in 2010 and given multiple disciplinary infractions. Then a . fight with another inmate in 2013 had led him to request a cell in solitary . confinement because he feared for his safety. In May 2013, Embry requested to stop taking anti-anxiety medications. In December, he was denied a request to resume them. Four . days later, he began refusing meals. He did not make clear why he began . the hunger strike, but he expressed suicidal thoughts and told a prison . psychologist: 'I have nothing left to live for.' His death prompted . an internal investigation by corrections officials and a separate . investigation by state police. A doctor was fired and others were investigated. Heartbroken: Hope Keown said her stepfather was 'the best ever' before they drifted apart . The . case exposed lapses in medical treatment and the handling of hunger . strikes, and the local prosecutor is considering whether a grand jury . should hear the case. Keown said that her stepfather had not always been so troubled. She recalled the good times, such as when a sober Embry helped with homework and folded laundry. He had drifted in and out of jails since 1978, serving short sentences for drug offenses and assault, but between stints behind bars, Embry had two sons and a daughter, married Mae Keown Embry and moved in with her and her two daughters. Embry entered Hope Keown's life when she was nine years old. 'When my stepdad was on his medication, he was the best ever!' said Keown. When he was sober, Embry was a hard-working man who was big on family dinners, helping with homework and teaching his stepchildren life skills, from changing a tire and saving money to washing dishes and folding laundry, Keown and her mother said. Embry purchased the crib and changing table for Keown's first child when she was 19. 'That was probably one of the last moments I really shared with him,' she said. But after a while, Embry 'grew bored and started partying with a certain group of friends that mom made clear was just a bad group of friends,' mainly people he had met in jail, she said. That's when he brought out 'Spider Red', the nickname he gave to the side of his personality fueled by alcohol and drugs - and the nickname he felt compelled to get tattooed on his right arm. Family members said Embry had battled for years with mental illness and addiction. As much as all of that drove them apart, it also fuels their anger at how his life ended in a tragic death while in the state's care. 'This man needed treatment,' Mae Embry said. 'Just because he's mentally ill, you don't throw him out with the dishwater.' He didn't like taking anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications and would start using drugs and alcohol, then land in jail. Things got worse when his father, Herman Embry, died in 2001 while James Embry was in jail. Officials wouldn't grant him furlough to attend the funeral. 'I think that changed him,' Keown said. 'I think he started to lose hope.' The marriage ended more than a decade ago, and Embry's family lost touch with him long before he began his final prison sentence. No dramatic moment led to the split, the family said. Instead, after the divorce, different lifestyles simply pushed him out of his loved ones' orbit. Mae Embry and Keown are now dealing with regrets and hope to make some amends by trying to move his remains to a family plot. 'Just because you're divorced doesn't mean we stopped caring about him,' Mae Embry said. 'It's just, sometimes when someone is like that, you need to move on with your life.'",

    "document": "By . Arthur Martin and Rupert Steiner . PUBLISHED: . 19:25 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:47 EST, 20 August 2013 . Jeremy Outen has resigned as the head of the National Crime Agency's Economic Crime Command after failing security checks . A senior fraud investigator put in charge of fighting financial crime at a new FBI-style police agency will not take up the job after claims he failed the security vetting. Jeremy Outen, a former partner at KPMG earning around £580,000 a year, was named as head of the National Crime Agency’s Economic Crime Command in April. Due to the role’s highly sensitive nature, he was put through extensive vetting with experts trawling through his financial affairs, employment and personal life. Last night well-placed sources confirmed that Mr Outen had failed the process. One said: ‘He failed the direct vetting procedure which was a requirement of the job. ‘Mr Outen was given the option of going through the process again, but he declined.’ Last night, the former forensic accountant told the Daily Mail he withdrew from the role for ‘personal reasons’ but declined to reveal details. Yesterday one report claimed his tax affairs had played a part in the decision. However, Mr Outen strenuously denied the allegation. His departure comes two weeks after the resignation of Sir Ian Andrews, chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which will be rolled into the NCA when it launches this year. Sir Ian quit after he failed to declare he owned a private company with his wife, who works for a global consultancy firm involved in security and investigations. SOCA also faces damaging allegations that it failed to investigate City companies over the employment of corrupt private investigators. Last night Mr Outen said: ‘The reason I’m leaving, or not joining, is entirely personal. It is personal to me and it is not something I really want to discuss. ‘I know that people want to know what it is but I am not going to tell anybody what it is and there we are.’ One report claimed Mr Outen quite over his tax affairs while the Home Office said he left for 'personal reasons' When asked if it was because he failed . the vetting, he said: ‘I can’t really talk about my vetting because the . whole issue is surrounded by confidentiality which was imposed on me . from the outset. ‘We are . into difficult territory. What I am saying is I’ve withdrawn from the . process and not the other way round, so you can work out from that that . my vetting status isn’t the issue.’ Mr Outen's departure comes two weeks after the resignation of Sir Ian Andrews as chairman of SOCA (pictured) Mr Outen added that he was ‘happy to deny categorically’ that his tax affairs were an issue. ‘I have not been involved in any tax avoidance, or any other such arrangements. I never have been,’ he said. ‘My tax affairs are very straightforward and I’m not aware that I am the subject of any investigation by the HMRC.’ When Mr Outen was appointed, Keith Bristow, director general of the NCA, said he was an ‘exceptional candidate’ who would be a major asset. Home Secretary Theresa May added that Mr Outen had ‘the skills and experience to tackle the challenges posed by economic crime’. Although he has never been a police officer, Mr Outen has worked closely with government departments and law enforcement agencies in investigating complex fraud cases at home and abroad. A forensic accountant with KPMG for 21 years, his previous cases have included the collapses of Kuwait Investment Office’s investments in Spain and SBS-Agro in Moscow. He has also investigated dormant Swiss bank accounts belonging to victims of Nazi persecution. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘Jeremy Outen has decided not to take up the post for personal reasons. Steps are being taken to ensure this position is filled.’",

    "document": "Thousands of bibles could be removed from university accommodation after they were branded 'inappropriate' in a multicultural environment. More than half of students surveyed at Aberystwyth University said they felt the compulsory inclusion of the book from Gideon International was 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable'. A proposal to have all bibles withdrawn from university-owned bedrooms will be put forward by the university's Students' Union council at a meeting later this month. Bibles could be removed from rooms at Aberystwyth University after more than half of students surveyed said the compulsory inclusion of the book from Gideon International was 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable' The US-based Christian organisation has been providing free bibles to universities for several years and has distributed 1.8billion globally to hotels, hospitals and care homes since 1908. A survey of students at Pentre Jane Morgan halls of residence was conducted by Aberystwyth Students' Union. It found that around 50 per cent of respondents found the compulsory inclusion of Bibles 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable' and only four per cent stated that it was a 'good idea'. The matter was raised at a student council meeting by student John David Morgan on January 22, where 50 people showed up. The motion, put forward at a student union council meeting, will be discussed later this month following results from the survey at Aberystwyth University (pictured) He said the 'inclusion of Bibles in university bedrooms is inappropriate in a multicultural university such as Aberystwyth.' 'It could be offensive for some, and the university should provide a safe space for students to explore and develop their beliefs in a neutral environment. 'Bibles should, however, still be available for those who wish to have them,' he added. The motion calls for all bibles to be removed from university bedrooms at the end of the current academic year. Mr Morgan proposed replacing it with an option in the accommodation application process to allow students to have a bible in their bedroom should they so wish. University bosses said it will review the policy if Aberystwyth Students' Union back their removal. An Aberystwyth University spokesman said that the books are 'replenished annually' and that there is no fine if they are taken from the rooms. The new rooms at the recently-opened Penglais Farm have yet to receive bibles, the spokesman added. Gideon International did not wish to comment on the recent proposal. James Catford, a former student of Aberystwyth University, and now the Group Chief Executive of Bible Society said: . 'The answer to a diverse and multicultural society is not to remove all traces of diversity. That seems illiberal and intolerant. 'As a graduate of the university, I would challenge those who are voting to spend some time with Luke's Gospel, for example, so they can make an informed decision. 'No student would vote in the General Election without knowing what each party and candidate stood for, and the same should be true of this vote. University bosses said it will review the policy if Aberystwyth Students' Union back the proposal to have the bibles removed by the end of the current academic year . 'Many people think they know what the Bible stands for but our research shows that nine out of ten don't engage with it – so the students might be surprised if they do.' Reverend Ian Girling, Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Aberystwyth, added: 'These bibles are a free gift to the students and have helped many over the years through difficult times so it would be a great shame to lose them. 'However, we, as local churches and chaplains, will continue to welcome all students to come and see us, whatever their circumstances and needs.' Other universities have banned Gideon Bibles removed in the past including Huddersfield University in 2013, which said it wanted its properties to be 'ethically neutral'. It also claimed to removed them because many of the students are from overseas, however, the move was branded 'anti-Christian' by Rev Mike Smith, a former minister at Huddersfield's Golcar Baptist Church. Stirling University Students' Association (SUSA) also called to have them removed from halls of residence, claiming it was 'presumptuous' and offensive to different religions on the campus. Last year, one of Britain's largest hotel chains - Travelodge - removed bibles from all its bedrooms for 'diversity reasons'. It said the policy was implemented 'in order not to discriminate against any religion' – despite having had no complaints from guests at any of its 500 hotels. Bibles were taken away at the same time as a refurbishment of its rooms, removing drawers where they were kept. The Gideon Society was founded in 1898 and has distributed 1.8billion free bibles in hotels, hospitals, prisons, care homes, medical centres as well as student accommodation . The practice of placing Bibles in British hotel rooms originated with the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association late in the Victorian era. The organisation was founded in 1888, with backing from the owners of biscuit manufacturer McVitie's, and donated bibles to hotels around the country. In more recent years, the work was taken over by the Gideon Society, which distributes free Bibles in almost 194 countries worldwide. Members of the Gideon Society, an evangelical Christian organisation founded in the US in 1898, were inspired to give out free Bibles in hotel rooms after visiting Britain and seeing the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association's work. In the UK, the Gideon Society, whose income comes from donations and bequests from wills, still continues this mission – giving out free bibles to large institutions, including hospitals and prisons. Copies of the New Testament are also presented to school pupils, members of the armed forces, police, ambulance and fire services.",

    "document": "This time last year, Tahysn was a happily married father of two little boys aged three and four and lived close to his large, extended family in the village of Shangal in Iraq's Nineveh province. Now, home is a ramshackle refugee camp under the protection of Kurdish peshmerga fighters and he is grieving the loss of his wife and sons. His story is far from unique. Like so many other Yazidis, his family were massacred by ISIS jihadis as they swept through northern Iraq in August. Like them, Tahysn has lost everything. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Tahsyn shows a photo of his two little boys. It is all he has left of them after they were murdered by IS . 'When the Daesh (a local slang term for ISIS) came to our village, I was not there but called my family and told them to leave. It was a big shock for everybody. 'They managed to escape the village but on the way to Mount Sinjar, they met Daesh. All of them were killed.' His eyes glistening with tears, he adds: 'My older brother, my father, my mother, my wife and even my two kids were killed. All I have left of them is just one picture on my mobile phone. 'The Daesh are just savages. They do not respect religion or humanity. They are not humans - even animals have more pity.' The first inkling that his formerly peaceful existence was coming to an end arrived when Mosul fell to the jihadis on June 10. As ISIS cut a swathe through the local population, forcing Christians to flee and killing anyone who resisted, the Yazidis watched uneasily. Gone: Nasser, from the village of Kocho near Sinjar, shows a photo of his small nephew who was killed . Grieving: Sefan, 16, is now without his father (pictured) and three brothers - all of whom were murdered . All that's left: This man's brother was killed by the jihadis. This photo is all he has to remember him by . Alone: Just eight years old, Azin has been forced to fend for herself after her parents were killed by ISIS . Their unease was justified for less than two months after the fall of Mosul, the fanatics were bearing down on their own doorsteps. The onslaught began on the 3rd August, when ISIS fighters surrounded the Kurdish town of Sinjar, which was once home to thousands of Yazidi families. Many ran but more still were murdered as the jihadis advanced. Some were offered the chance to convert to Islam. Women were kidnapped and raped, as were children. Others escaped to the top of Mount Sinjar, where, surrounded by jihadi forces, they faced death by starvation and exposure or at the hands of ISIS. It was only when the international community, spurred into action by harrowing photos of their plight, launched airstrikes and air drops of relief supplies, that they were saved. But for many, Tahysn among them, the horrors of the ISIS advance remain fresh - and the wounds all too raw. Bleak: This family was forced to walk for seven days to reach Zohar. The baby was named Nojin - New Life . Tough: The Yazidis living in Zohar have tents and some food but worry about what winter will bring . Grim: The camp sits in the middle of a bleak stretch of wilderness, valuable only for what lies beneath . Temptation: A flaring oil well just behind the camp hints at the financial reason for the ISIS onslaught . Azin, an eight-year-old girl now living in a school in the town of Zohar, is another Yazidi who lost everything when the jihadis attacked. Her parents were captured by the jihadis as they attempted to escape, while Azin herself was forced to endure a trek that lasted seven days. 'My father and my mother are no longer with me,' she says, heartbreakingly matter-of-fact. 'They were caught by Daesh on the day we left Sinjar. I escaped on my own.' The eight-year-old has no idea where her family might be or even if they are still alive. But she remembers the men who tore her world apart all too well. 'The men from Daesh had long beards and big weapons,' she remembers. 'I walked for seven days in the hills to escape them. I do not know if my parents are still alive.' Others, who were forced to leave their homes so quickly that they could take nothing with them, complain that their children have been left impoverished and hungry. Survivor: This boy is one of thousands who have fled to Zohar and Lalesh in the face of the ISIS advance . Escape: This lady told MailOnline that she would rather die than be enslaved by ISIS . Destitute: Resho was forced to leave behind all his goats - and the bodies of 45 family members . Alone: Rezal (left) has been left to care for her grandchildren while this lady (right) saw babies being killed . Others, such as grandmother Rezal, who also comes from Sinjar, have been left to bring up orphaned children and mourn others for whom the hot and dusty journey up the side of the mountain proved too much. 'When we left Sinjar, the kids suffered a lot,' says Rezal. 'They cried a lot because we needed to walk day and night. 'Many men from our village died, many women have been captured. I saw some kids dying because of the heat - it was nearly 50 degrees. 'The Daesh caught my brother and seven members of my family, including one who was 90. I do not have any news. I do not know whether any of them are still alive.' Now living in a refugee camp in Lalesh, a village that holds special significance for the Yazidi and the location of their holiest religious site, she worries about the privations that winter might bring. 'In Lalesh, the weather is cold,' she frets. 'Winter is coming and we are in a terrible state of health and mind. 'We do not own anything anymore, we had leave everything. We have no clothes, no furniture, no ornaments…Nothing.' Memories: The surviving members of one family look at photos of their lost loved ones . Brave: Many of the refugees living in the two camps are terribly traumatised children . Lucky: Two of this mother's children were injured as they fled. Both have been flown to Paris for treatment . 'We have left Sinjar through the hills,' adds another mother, who did not want to be named. 'We walked for seven days and seven nights. We had no food and no water. 'The Daesh caught my two sons, my father and two of my sisters. I have no news from them and I do not know if they are even alive. 'Daesh are crazy people,' she adds. 'They even cut the throats of the babies. They want us, the Yazidis, to convert to Islam, but we refuse. 'As long as we are not in their hands, we survive. We prefer to die instead of being their slaves.' Although the refugees have been provided with food and tents, it is the psychological scars - particularly among the younger children - that will take longest to fix. Like Azin, Hassan, 13, was forced to flee alone and is now living in a refugee camp. He has no idea where his parents are and says many of his friends were murdered, . Scarred: Hassan, 13, saw 100 boys from his village murdered by ISIS, among them best friend Kasi, nine . Horrors: Like Hassan, this little girl witnessed the murder of her friends and family . Hiding: Many families have taken refuge in the Yazidi temple at Lalesh . Revenge: This little boy has vowed revenge on ISIS and wants to make them suffer as his family has . 'The Daesh came suddenly into my village with many men,' he recounts. 'I didn't understand what was happening and I was so scared. 'I ran but many of my friends were killed. I lost my best friend Kasi - he was nine. The Daesh killed nearly 100 kids from my village.' 'When I grow up, I will beat the Daesh,' adds another camp resident, a young boy who waves a small pistol in the air as he does so. 'I will kill them all. I will take revenge for all the Yazidi people. I want the Daesh to live through what we suffered because of them.'",
    "summary": "An estimated 200,000 Yazidi were forced to flee as ISIS advanced . Thousands were murdered while scores of women were taken as slaves . Some survivors such as Tahsyn lost their entire families as they escaped . Others saw babies murdered and women of all ages being raped . Most now live in refugee camps near Lalesh and Zohar in northern Iraq ."

    "document": "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 23:17 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:11 EST, 21 September 2012 . Paul Burstow, who was sacked in the Cabinet reshuffle, has hit out at Chancellor George Osborne . George Osborne was today accused of trying to consign reform elderly care to the ‘trash bin’. Liberal Democrat Paul Burstow, who was social care minister until this month’s reshuffle, accused the Chancellor and the Treasury of ‘bureaucratic inertia’ in holding back reform of the social care system. Mr Burstow told MailOnline that an overhaul of the way care is funded, based on proposals drawn up by economist Andrew Dilnot has been finalised, but the Treasury will not sign off on the £1.7bn cost.‘In the end there is a question of political will to overcome that bureaucratic inertia,’ he said. ‘The thing that has kept Dilnot alive has been the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying this has got to stay on the table while there was a desire by the Treasury to get it in the trash bin as quickly as possible. ‘It is an institutional thing. There is a real inertia around reforms of this sort that has bedevilled reform of social care for two decades. ‘I have no doubt it was a key factor why Labour failed to deal with it when there was money around. ‘It has been a key drag on trying to make progress over the last two years of the coalition.’ Last month it was reported that David Cameron had pledged to find the money, which would cap the amount individuals pay at £35,000 – with the taxpayer picking up the rest. But Mr Burstow said there was little sense of urgency: ‘There was certainly no sign of the Treasury beating a path to the door of the Department of Health.’ However, government insiders sought to play down Mr Burstow’s insight into the progress of the plan. ‘If this former minister really believes what he has said he was clearly out of the loop,’ said one source. It is utter nonsense.’ Mr Burstow also claimed that the controversial reforms of the NHS, drawn up by Andrew Lansley who was demoted in the reshuffle, had made senior minister reluctant to tackle social care. ‘There is no doubt that the controversy around the health reforms made some of the actors in this worry about future reform. ‘But many of those players, including the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and others, probably hadn’t tuned into enough at the time to see the fact that this was a popular set of changes not a controversial set of changes.’ Chancellor George Osborne was accused of having 'no sense of urgency' about helping the elderly fund their long-term care . Mr Burstow said he had received scores of ‘heart-rending’ letters form families in despair at the care system’ ‘I still think there is a good chance . this can happen but the only way to help it happen at this point is . bringing into sharp relief the Treasury’s role.’ Mr Dilnot suggested a cap of £35,000 . for care bills. The state would pay costs over this amount while people . could also take out insurance to pay fees up to £35,000. Ministers said they supported the idea in principle but have not committed the £1.7billion needed to fund the reform. The Government is considering a . watered down version, which could impose a voluntary cap which would . only protect those who paid a fee to ‘opt in’. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr . Burstow added: ‘The Treasury’s view is simple, kick the can down the . road ... There’s no sense of urgency.’ But a Treasury spokesman said: ‘The . Treasury has been key in getting this issue back on the agenda, not . least by working to deliver stable public finances that are essential if . Dilnot is to be delivered.’ Campaigners responded to Mr Burstow's remarks with a call for government action. Michelle Mitchell, charity director general of Age UK said: 'Putting a cap on lifetime care costs would grant older people and their families the invaluable gift of peace of mind. 'Coming toward the end of life and having to ask for help in carrying out everyday tasks is often devastating in itself but in addition to risk losing nearly everything you have ever worked for in care fees is heart-breaking. 'Those living in a care home have to live with the fear of what will happen to them when their savings run out and whether they will be forced to leave. 'This is why the Government must show the vision and courage to bring in the Dilnot reforms as the report recommended and so create a just and compassionate legacy for generations to come.' Labour today repeated its offer of cross-party talks to find a long-term solution to the funding of elderly care. Liz Kendall, shadow care minister said: 'Labour has been warning for months that the Government is kicking long-term care funding into the long grass. 'This issue has bedevilled Governments of all political persuasions for many years, because there are no simple solutions or easy options. 'All the parties must now come together to try and reach consensus about . how we tackle the immediate care crisis and develop a better, fairer . system for the future.'",

    "document": "Britain should switch to a four-day working week to combat stress, a leading doctor has said. Professor John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said that shorter hours would allow workers to spend more time with their families and help reduce unemployment. Reducing the standard working week from five days to four would also help combat medical conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. Health benefits: Shorter hours would help beat stress and combat conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. Britons are notorious for putting in some of the longest hours in Europe . Professor Ashton, who has spent almost 40 years working in public health, said: ‘When you look at the way we lead our lives, the stress that people are under, the pressure on time and sickness absence, [work-related] mental health is clearly a major issue. ‘We should be moving towards a four-day week because we problem we have in the world of work is you’ve got a proportion who are working too hard and a proportion that haven’t got jobs. ‘We’ve got a maldistribution of work. The lunch-hour has gone; people just have a sandwich at their desk and carry on working.’ Professor Ashton, who leads more than 3,300 public health experts working in the NHS, local government and academia, spoke out after the law was changed to give all employees the right to ask for flexible hours. This could mean anything from a three-day week to only working during the school term time – options that had been reserved for parents and carers. Britons are notorious for putting in some of the longest hours in Europe, with the average worker clocking up some 250 hours more a year than their German counterpart. 'Crazy hours': Professor John Ashton (pictured) said that some Britons are working too much . One in three British adults has high blood pressure, a ‘silent killer’ that trebles the risk of heart attacks and strokes. It can also damage the kidneys and eyes and is becoming increasingly linked to dementia. Around one in six workers is experiencing stress, anxiety or depression at any one time, the charity Mind says. Professor Ashton said that some Britons are working ‘crazy hours’, while others can’t get a job. He said that a shorter working week would give more time for exercise and family life, including the opportunity to do the school run. He told the Guardian: ‘We need a four-day week so that people can enjoy their lives, have more time with their families and maybe reduce high blood pressure because people might start exercising on that extra day. ‘If you’ve got two people in a couple working, they need to be able to work in such a way that they can spend time together with their children. It’s a nightmare.’ A recent YouGov poll found that 57 per cent of workers are in favour of a four-day week. The Trades Union Congress agreed that many people would welcome as shorter working week but questioned how easy it would be to for them to obtain. Professor Ashton said: ‘The practicalities of implementing such a policy would be complex, not least because of the high cost of living that prohibits many people from working fewer hours. ‘Nevertheless, it is important that we have a working pattern that is good for our health as well as our economy and wider society.’",
    "summary": "Four-day week would fight high blood pressure and mental health problems . It would also give workers more family time, said Professor John Ashton . He spoke out after change in law to give all employees right to flexible hours . Patterns could include three-day weeks or working only during term time ."

Murder probe: Dr Gary Hughes was found dead at his home in Feock, and his wife Marion is believed to have been arrested . The wife of a GP has been arrested by police on suspicion of murder after her doctor husband was stabbed to death at their £700,000 home. Gary Hughes, 60, was found dead in the coastal village of Feock, Cornwall, at 7.40am today and his wife Marion is believed to have been held by police. Officers said they found the body of a man with stab wounds to the chest and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Mrs Hughes also suffered injuries and was taken to hospital but police said her wounds were not life threatening. Mr Hughes was a GP in the Camborne and Redruth area of Cornwall. Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'This is the beginning of an investigation. 'But early indications suggest this was a domestic incident and no-one else is being sought at this time. 'An investigation had now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.' Neighbour, Chris Young, said: 'When it comes so close to your doorstep it is very worrying. This is a very quiet area with very few passers-by.' Villager Cynthia Vanstone said: 'He was a lovely doctor. He was willing to help anyone'. Dr Hughes, qualified in 1977, was a Senior Partner at the Clinton Road NHS surgery in Redruth, Cornwall. The surgery's website lists his interests are obstetrics and family planning and said in his spare time he liked to go sailing. Probe: Police have sealed off Dr Hughes' property in Feock, Cornwall, where he was found with stab wounds . Dr Hughes, who had two sons, had continued a proud family tradition by following both his parents to become a GP. His late mother treated the survivors of the infamous Belsen concentration camp at the end of World War II. Dr June Hughes, who died in February last year at the age of 91, started her medical training in 1939 and was called up to serve as an Army doctor in 1944. After the war she became one of the first female doctors in Cornwall and married fellow GP Edward Hughes. They both worked as family doctors in picturesque villages around Truro from Chacewater to Feock. Gary, who was known to the family as 'Tiger', was their only son but her and his wife had six daughters: Rona, Anne, Jessica, Marion, Norna and Nina. The family home at Feock was used as a medical practice from 1962 and Dr Hughes and her husband carried out weekly surgeries in nearby St Day and Ponsanooth.

Big Brother star Josie Gibson was in court to support her grandmother, who is facing jail for drug offences. The reality TV personality joined other members of her family at Bristol Crown Court yesterday to see Diane Gibson, 72, sentenced. The grandmother had been on the run for over 12 years, having been convicted in 2000 at Bristol Crown Court of possessing cocaine with intent to supply. Big Brother star Josie Gibson arrives at Bristol Crown Court for the case of her grandmother Diane Gibson, who is set to sentenced on drug charges after 12 years on the run . Diane Gibson disappeared in 2000 after she was found guilty of possessing with intent to supply 3kg of cocaine worth £240,000 . She fled after being caught with 3kg of the drug worth £240,000. Detectives feared the woman - dubbed 'Britain's most wanted grandmother' - may have changed her appearance and fled to Spain. But police finally caught up with her and she was arrested last month at the home of a relative in Yate, south Gloucestershire. Yesterday she returned to court to be sentenced. Gibson waved to family members in the public gallery, including the Big Brother star, as she was brought up from the cells. The case was adjourned at the request of Gibson’s barrister Giles Nelson for five weeks to allow medical reports to be compiled, which may affect sentencing. He told Judge Michael Longman that Gibson suffers from heart problems and is seeing specialists at hospitals in Bristol. 'The upshot is that she is using a wheelchair because of heart problems and blood pressure which has affected her mobility,' Mr Nelson said. Mr Nelson said that Gibson was still maintaining her innocence and an earlier appeal had been rejected. Josie Gibson defended her grandmother on Twitter, saying people didn't know the truth and that she was 'heavily against drugs' Adjourning the case until next month and . remanding the pensioner in custody, the judge told her: 'I am . adjourning until June 10 so that those defending you can find out . further information that may assist you.'

Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, recently spent months travelling across the US, and documented his interactions with locals all around the country. From a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about Britney Spears, to a man who insisted Murray was saying 'Get out of my nightgown', the filmmaker captured it all. Scroll down for video . Aussie filmmaker Kieran Murray has released the second installment of his hilarious series which asks Americans to attempt the Australian accent by saying 'G'day mate, how you going? One man in Austin, Texas (far right) was convinced Murray said 'Get out (of) my nightgown' This is the latest in a series of videos Murray put together one of which is based around the same topic, and another of which asks people to guess what common Australian expressions mean. 'I don't even know what he said!' exclaimed one Texan when asked by the Brisbane man to repeat the phrase. 'Say it again in English?', asked a man in Manhattan, New York. 'Sounds Chinese to me man,' he later added. Many people threw strange sideways glances at the man, trying to understand what he was saying, with one man declaring 'that's Spanish!'. Others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic Australian vernacular, and Murray also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of Britney Spears' dads house. This New Yorker said 'sounds Chinese to me man', when speaking to the Brisbane man . One man in Nashville responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the Aussie accent . This man, who didn't quite get the gist of the question, was insistent on telling a story about Britney Spears . 'I lived in the back, of Britney Spears' dads house', the man, who appears to be homeless, told the filmaker over and over again. When he was asked again to repeat the phrase after Murray, he simply said: 'All right'. While on the subway Murray asked one man to repeat what he said, but he simply declared 'Can't do it'. 'I don't know what you said, were those words?' one woman, who appeared to be at a sporting event, asked the Australian. 'What the hell'd you say?' exclaimed one hog hunter in Texas. Kids giggled as they tried to understand what Murray was saying in his Australian accent . Many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused Americans . Children weren't much better and translating the popular Aussie phrase, but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in Austin, Texas. 'Wait I got this,' the man said while surrounded by his friends before triumphantly proclaiming: 'Get out my nightgown!'. 'That's the one. Get out my nightgown. I got it right, I already know I got it,' the man said. Murray even managed to stump a speech therapist who struggled to understand the Australian accent. The video, aptly titled 'G'day Mate: The Sequel' can be viewed in full on Murray's YouTube page.",

The disused Rhondda Tunnel, which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills, was closed as part of the Beeching cutbacks, a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in Britain. But engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route. Scroll down for video . A two-mile Victorian railway tunnel which was closed as part of the Beeching cutbacks could reopen as Britain's longest cycle tunnel . The disused Rhondda Tunnel, which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills, was closed 50 years ago . It was shut down as part of the sweeping Beeching Report, which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network . Under the proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S. It would also mean cyclists could retrace the route where steam locomotives carried coal from the Rhondda Valley to the port city of Swansea - something which supporters believe could be a huge boom to the tourist industry. Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, said: 'There is a real buzz about this project which could transform these valleys if the tunnel is opened up.' The railway tunnel, the seventh biggest in Britain, runs beneath the mountains under the Dunraven Forest in the South Wales Valleys. But engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route . The railway tunnel, which runs beneath the mountains under the Dunraven Forest in the South Wales Valleys, was opened in 1890 in the coal boom. It was then closed in 1968 . It was opened in 1890 during the coal boom, after a five-year building project, which was overseen by the tunnel's chief engineer Sydney William Yockney, a pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. But both ends of the tunnel - at Blaencwm in the Rhondda and Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley - were filled in during the 1970s. It came following a report by Dr Richard Beeching, a civil servant from the Isle of Sheppy, who wrote a report called Reshaping of British Railways, which led to far-reaching changes in the transport network. The engineer had been employed to make the entire network more profitable, prompting him to recommend the closure of stations and railway lines which did not make money. The tunnel runs from Blaencwm in the Rhondda Valley to Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley (shown in map) How the tunnel's length will compare to those around the world, according to the Rhonda Tunnel Society . Under the proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S . Although some 3,000 miles of railway lines were closed before the report, he became infamous for causing the closures of several rural stations. The report became commonly known as the Beeching Axe. After falling victim to the report, the abandoned Rhondda Tunnel lay dormant for nearly 50 years. But the Rhondda Tunnel Society formed a few years ago in a bid to secure funding for the tunnel's excavation. The Highways Agency Historic Railways Estate has now contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three-day inspection of the tunnel, alongside the Mines Rescue Service. Rhondda Tunnel Society chairman Stephen Mackey said it would be a 'heart-stopping' three days. The chief engineer of the tunnel (left) was Sydney William Yockney, a pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who oversaw the five-year building project which it began in 1885. Pictured right: Workers at the Rhonnda Tunnel . The Highways Agency Historic Railways Estate has contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three-day inspection of the tunnel, alongside the Mines Rescue Service . The Rhondda Tunnel Society formed with the sole purpose of reopening the Victorian locomotive route . He said: 'The engineers will be walking the length of the tunnel across three days looking at the safety of the structure to see what it's like after 47 years and to see if it is possible to re-open the tunnel. 'As well as the structural integrity they will be checking for such things as sulphuric acid which can occur in stagnant water and to check carbon dioxide levels to make sure it's breathable down there.' He added: 'With the interest of the world looking in on the project, the inspections next week are going to be crucial with engineers being in the dark depths of the tunnel evaluating its integrity. 'These are exciting times for us but also a heart-stopping three days. Then we will have the wait for the report and the subsequent findings.' The tunnel was built by the demands of the coal industry to run from pit villages Blaencwm in the Rhondda Valley under the mountains to Blaengwynfi in the Afan Valley . The plaque at the Blaencwm entrance of the tunnel. It is being inspected next week for the first time since it closed . Engineer Dr Richard Beeching, whose report led to the reduction of the British railway network . In 1963, Dr Richard Beeching, a civil servant from the Isle of Sheppey, was recruited by the government to write a report about how to make the railway network more profitable. After being recruited from the job from ICI, he produced a report called Reshaping of British Railways - a document which changed the face of British railways forever. At the time, railway lines were extensive across Britain and even very remote areas had stations. But, with the industry hemorrhaging money, Dr Beeching's solution was to close down the parts - including stations and lines - which did not make money. He recommended axing about one third of the network, which equated to around 5,000 miles of track. This included hundreds of branch lines, 2,363 stations and tens of thousands of jobs lost on the grounds of cost or efficienvy. His recommendations left Britain with 13,721 miles of railway lines in 1966, while a further 2,000 miles were lost by the end of the 1960s. Dr Beeching argued it was more important to invest in fast journeys between the cities and to replace some branch lines with improved bus services. But the report became infamous and Dr Beeching was criticised for ignoring the social benefits of having a rail line. His programme also never made the savings he promised. However, many critics failed to recognise that the government had already cut 3,000 miles of track before Dr Beeching's input, something which was continued by successive governments.",

    "document": "David Cameron this morning launched a furious attack on Labour MPs 'bleating' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year. The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: ‘True compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance.’ He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning £87 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not ‘playing the system’ but were ‘victims of it’. He said they were ‘victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers’. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net – not a web from which no-one could escape. ‘So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. ‘It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don’t you dare lecture us on poverty. ‘And know this – the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.’ Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. ‘For many second earners, work didn’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. ‘In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £5,000 to working families. ‘That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017.’ Mr Cameron also argued ‘that true compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance’. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £350 million a year.",
    "summary": "Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare . He accused Ed Miliband of having 'some brass neck' by attacking Tories . Mr Cameron said he wanted to 'make hard work pay' unlike Labour . He said that work rather than benefits is the best way to avoid poverty . The Prime Minister announced 600,000 new childcare places today ."

    "document": "(CNN)It started with neighbors and local officials digging with their hands through the rubble. As soon as a deadly earthquake stopped rattling a swath of Nepal, before the scope of the damage was calculated, the digging began. The magnitude-7.8 earthquake has killed more than 1,800 people, and the death toll is expected to rise. One witness, Joe McEnness, captured a photo of police officers in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, trying to dig survivors out of a collapsed building. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its volunteers and staff were aiding rescue efforts and providing first aid to the injured. The Red Cross opened a blood bank in Kathmandu. Reports from Nepal indicated that hospitals were overflowing with patients and suffering from shortages. One doctor in the outskirts of Kathmandu put out a plea for engineers to come to his hospital to help back up the electricity supply. \"Victims will be dying if we don't have it,\" Dr. Subhash Acharya tweeted. At another hospital, CNN's Manesh Shrestha saw people being turned away as doctors focused on the most dire needs, he said. He saw people lying outside with broken bones and head injuries. With communication limited, many turned to social media to ask for help locating their loved ones. Google India launched a person finder website to work as a clearinghouse for information on those who are missing and those who have been found. As of Saturday night in Nepal, Google was tracking some 1,400 records. Facebook activated Safety Check, which alerts users of any friends who are in the disaster zone. Those in the affected area can use Facebook to alert their family and friends that they are OK. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to the country, the Embassy said via Twitter. Nepal's neighbor India deployed teams to Kathmandu almost immediately. Within hours of the quake, India had sent almost 300 personnel, along with search dogs and supplies. The equipment arrived in Nepal via a series of cargo and airlift planes, including a C-130 Super Hercules, one IL-76, and two C-17 Globemasters, according to India's Ministry of Defense. Two additional helicopters were deployed from India but turned back because of bad weather, the ministry said. India said Sunday that it would dispatch 10 more aid flights to Nepal, along with 10 helicopters to assist in search-and-rescue efforts. Disaster management and medical personnel as well as mobile hospitals, food, water, blankets and medicine will be on the aid flights, Ministry of Defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said. Pakistan announced it is sending a medical team, a 30-bed hospital and search-and-rescue experts. The Pakistani search team is specialized for rescues in natural disasters, officials said, and comes equipped with ground-penetrating radar and concrete cutters. Pakistan is sending meals, water, medicine and other supplies. China, meanwhile, announced that it will send 40 rescuers and six search dogs. Israel's military was preparing to send a team to assess the damage from the quake ahead of a humanitarian mission, the Israel Defense Forces said.

Concrete from a construction project crashed onto the family's car, killing Josh and Vanessa Ellis and their 8-month-old son, Hudson, authorities said. \"The damage was so severe it was impossible to tell how many victims were in the vehicle. The only thing we had was we could tell there was one victim,\" said Officer Todd Green of Bonney Lake Police Department, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. It took nine hours Monday for crews to remove enough debris to discover the death toll on Angeline Road underneath State Route 410, authorities said. Authorities continued their investigation Tuesday, but initial findings were that there was an ongoing construction project on the highway and a side jersey barrier \"came loose and fell onto the roadway,\" Green told the station. \"When it fell off the overpass, it landed square on the roof of the vehicle,\" Green added. Josh and Vanessa Ellis were youth pastors at the EastPointe Foursquare Church in Puyallup, near Bonney Lake, the church said. The couple earlier wrote a short autobiography on the church website: \"We love to laugh. We are passionate about seeing young people discover the love and grace that Jesus abundantly pours out on them. \"We get really excited about good coffee, quality time with friends and Seattle welcoming an NBA basketball team back to our city,\" the couple wrote. \"We love drive-in movies, frozen yogurt, dates to IKEA and trips to the beach.\" Lead Pastor James Ludlow said his church was reeling. \"We are stunned! Shocked! Wounded, broken and dismayed. But we know one thing for sure ... they are in glory in the loving arms of our King Jesus!\" Ludlow said on the church's Facebook page. Motorist Dawn Nelson was driving behind the Ellis' vehicle. \"I was just a second or two behind him,\" Nelson told KOMO. \"I could hear the three crunch sounds and then it just came down.\" Neighbors recounted a violent collapse. \"I thought a semi had come down the guardrail here in front,\" neighbor Katie Vance told the station. She felt the crash inside her home. \"It was a metal sound and a very heavy sound ... it was through your feet - like a guttural. It shook the whole house,\" she told the affiliate.

    "document": "Jemma Peacock (pictured on her wedding day) says the NHS is denying her two daughters (pictured) their mother by refusing to fund a life-saving drug . A terminally-ill cancer sufferer has accused the NHS of denying her two daughters their mother by refusing to fund a potentially life-extending drug. Jemma Peacock, 31, suffers from a rare form of stomach cancer and is currently taking three drugs to try to prolong her life. The third and most effective drug - regorafenib - costs the NHS around £1,000 a week to provide and has been removed from the health service's approved list of treatments. Mrs Peacock, who lives with her husband Tony and daughters Kacie, six, and Willow, four, in Storrington, West Sussex, has wild-type gastrointestinal cancer, which causes tumours to grow in the stomach and intestines. The mother-of-two, who is yet to tell her young children about her condition, says she cannot afford to buy regorafenib privately and has called on NHS England to reverse their decision. She said: 'The final drug is the most effective and it is heart breaking they have removed it from the treatment list. 'The cancer that I have is extremely rare and the research into it is limited so it angers me that they are removing a drug that has been proven to work. 'I am lucky that I have managed to spend 14 months on the first drug, Imatinib, in the series but I know that it will soon have no effect on my body. 'The second drug, Sutan, is not very effective and I know that when I have to be put on it I will have minimal time left. 'You can buy regorafenib privately but that costs £3,700 a month and I don't have that kind of money. 'Family members have offered to sell their houses and belongings to pay for my treatment but I can't accept that. 'I cannot ask my family to put their lives on hold when I might only get another year of life.' Mrs Peacock (pictured with daughters Kacie, left, and Willow, right), who has a rare form of stomach cancer, has been refused a drug which could help her battle the disease . The mother-of-two, who set up a 100,000-strong petition for the drug regorafenib to be funded, has not told her daughters that she has cancer . Mrs Peackock, who lives in Storrington, West Sussex, with her daughters and husband Tony, has wild-type gastrointestinal cancer, which causes tumours to grow in the stomach and intestines . After NHS England removed the drug from their list of treatments in January this year, Mrs Peacock launched a petition calling on the NHS to reinstate it. More than 100,000 people have signed it, meaning MPs will have to discuss the issue in Parliament when they return to the Commons after the election - but by then Mrs Peacock's cancer may have progressed. Despite thousands joining her cause, Mrs Peacock is yet to tell her daughters that she has cancer. 'I do not want to scare them with what I am going through,' she said. 'We had to watch my dad die of lung cancer just 18 months ago and the girls found that really tough as they were very close to him. 'If I told them I had cancer it would scare them and no parent wants to scare their child. I do spoil them more then what other parents would but who can blame me. 'I want them to have as many happy memories with us as a family as possible before I get too ill and I can no longer enjoy the time I have. 'I think about the conversation I will have to have with them in the future and it heart wrenching that I will have to tell my daughters I will soon not be here anymore. 'But I know that I have to push that conversation to the back of mind and enjoy the time I have left with my family.' The NHS currently spends in the region of £1.3billion on cancer drugs a year, and receives a further £200million annual boost from the Cancer Drugs Fund - which helps to fund treatments for rare forms of the disease. NHS England then decides what drugs this money goes towards, with a ruling in January removing regorafenib from the fund's list because the treatment's effectiveness did not represent 'sufficient value for retention'. The report found that, on average, it cost £4,493 to provide a four-week cycle of regorafenib to a patient, with the average recipient needing the drug for 23 weeks. NHS England declined to comment.",

    "document": "(CNN)Saturday's deadly earthquake in Nepal was the \"big one\" experts were waiting for based on the region's history. Earthquakes are a fact of life in the South Asian country, with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year, geologist and science journalist Kate Ravilious said. With the last major earthquake in 1934, the concern was not if, but when the next \"great\" earthquake would hit, said Ravilious, author of the 2014 article, \"Kathmandu's earthquake nightmare.\" In a landlocked country like Nepal, where infrastructure is fragile to begin with, the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be \"much more serious,\" Ravilious told CNN. Those fears were realized when a magnitude-7.8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of Kathmandu rocked Nepal, toppling homes, historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead, authorities said. \"This event, while large and tragic, is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from Tibet almost to Caspian Sea is an area of major collision between continental plates,\" said geological engineer Nicholas Sitar with the University of California, Berkeley's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. What's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of Kathmandu, which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes. \"The population has exploded in several decades,\" U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Gavin Hayes told CNN. \"When you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that isn't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size, that's when you see the scale of disaster we're seeing now.\" The big unknown is what happens next, now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed, Ravilious said. How will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country, whose single international airport is closed? How will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed? If and when landslides start, how will mountainside villages in the Himalayan range fare? And, will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts? \"The worry now is to get Nepal up and running again on feet,\" Ravilious said. \"The monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we don't sort things out before then.\" An earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake. Nepal is located on a major plate boundary between India and Eurasia, where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years. Those collisions are responsible for the construction of the Himalayas, which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world, said Chris Goldfinger, director of Oregon State University's Active Tectonics and Seafloor Mapping Laboratory. India is moving northward into Eurasia at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year, with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the Himalaya every 500 to 1,000 years, said Marin K. Clark, associate professor of Geological Sciences with the University of Michigan's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The last major earthquake to affect this part of the Himalayas was in the 1500s, and Kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of Saturday's quake in 1934. A major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking, Clark said. The entire area that experienced shaking was in steep, mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard. Clark compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, China. The magnitude-7.9 earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides, many of which blocked roads, slowing response and recovery efforts. The landslides also blocked river valleys, which created significant flood hazard. \"We might anticipate a similar situation for Nepal.\"",
    "summary": "Earthquake scientists have been expecting major event in Nepal since 1934 . Population density, weak building infrastructure amplified damage, USGS spokesman says . \"This event, while large and tragic, is not unusual\" in region, geological engineer says ."

    "document": "It appears nowadays that it is not an official holiday until you've uploaded your pictures to Instagram with the intention of letting all those at home know how incredible your time away is. From the food you ate for dinner, to the bags you lovingly packed for the plane, every detail of our 'luxurious' travels can be documented for social media feeds. However sometimes we are guilty of not showing the entire story, and the truth can paint a whole other picture. Scroll down for video . Instagram: The wondrous Great Wall of China (pictured without visitors) weaves its way through the rolling countryside . Reality: Brace yourself to battle your way through your walk, not only physically, but also through the hordes of tourists . The Great Wall of China was created in 500 BC to protect the country's northern border against foreign invasion. While you may have visions of a peaceful stroll along the historic walkway, the truth is you need to be prepared for a slightly different scenario. The wall attracts over 10 million visitors annually so you could be battling your way through the crowds and not just the steep inclines. Instagram: Private planes comes with plenty of legroom and leather interiors, making travel incredible for stars such as Justin Bieber . Reality: Most of us travel with barely any legroom with hundreds of strangers and possibly screaming babies . It is sad to say that flying on a private jet, and on a commercial flight are polar opposite travelling experiences. While it is still fun to get on a plane, with the promise of a holiday on the other side, seeing Instagram pictures from Justin Bieber's luxury spacious aircraft could make us wishing we had won the lottery. Battling with the person in front for their reclining chair not touching your lap, and craning to see the in-flight movie are all part of the fun that comes with the reality of economy flying. Instagram: Beyonce snapped this close-up shot of herself right next to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at The Louvre, making us all believe we can get easy front-row access to the painting . Reality: Be prepared to wade through hordes of tourists and avoid getting other cameras in your shot while visiting the Mona Lisa . The Louvre attracts 9.7 million visitors a year, more than any other museum in the world. Despite Beyonce making us all believe we can just stroll up and get a front-row shot, the reality is less than rosy. Huge crowds could be blocking the way between you and the mysterious smile, and it is an art in itself snapping the portrait without getting a few cameras in shot. Instagram: Russian photographer Murad Osmann follows his stunning girlfriend to the world's most famous sights and landmarks, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin . Reality: Walk to the other side of Germany's famous landmark and the traffic of the city somewhat destroys the romance . Brandenburg Gate is the main entrance to the German capital of Berlin and features a picturesque 18th-century neoclassical triumphal arch. Photos posted on Instagram show celebrities strolling up to the iconic structure. But what would make this landmark more appealing would be if it was not surrounded by busy road traffic, and pollution from cars. Instagram: Model Karlie Kloss revealed her essentials for travel on Instagram, perfectly laid out in the X-ray tray at customs . Reality: Not everyone has time to arrange their ultra-stylish hand luggage items neatly as they join long queues to pass through security . Often travel and packing a suitcase can look effortless and sophisticated, when photographs have been carefully selected, with a tactical filter applied. For some, this is the norm, but for others, the sit and zip method of packing, and the rushed cram are the travel scenarios they are most accustomed to. We can all dream of the day we achieve the relaxed and organised packing experience. Instagram: Having roof access to the best partying scenes, overlooking a pool looks easy when you are Khloe Kardashian . Reality: Battling through the crowds to get a drink, surrounded by thousands of other partygoers trying to not get a drink spilt on you . Attending the biggest and best parties in Miami is a challenge, both in getting a ticket to get inside, and surviving once you are there. It can look so easy on Instagram, as Khloe Kardashian showed us, enjoying her time on the roof overlooking the pool. But almost all visitors are crammed onto the floor with heads obstructing their views of the DJ on the stage. Instagram: The glorious Taj Mahal is resplendent, with or without an Instagram filter and the internet is full of spectacular sunset pictures . Reality: Unfortunately, the reality of trying to capture that all-important sunset picture is a little more crowded . It is undeniable that the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, is one of the most beautiful mausoleums in the world. This thought is shared by the three million tourists who go to photograph the iconic landmark. Sadly the outskirts around the temple have less attention than the marble temple, with litter collecting on the banks of the Yamuna River. Instagram: The beautiful Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen looks impressive against a dramatic sky . Reality: If you can push past the crowds you will be able to see the mermaid, which sits at 4.1ft tall . The bronze mermaid statue by sculpture Edvard Eriksen was erected on a rock at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1913. It was based on the Little Mermaid fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Anderson and has drawn a lot of attention over the years. It once had its head sawn off by politically oriented artists of the Situationist movement in 1964, and again by an unknown culprit in 1998. Instagram: Stretching out on the plane while enjoying fine cuisine such a lobster, as you soar to your luxurious holiday . Reality: Plastic trays litter your tray table as you wait for the flight attendant to collect whatever it was you ate . Plane food has never had the reputation of being the best meal travellers have ever had. This is not helped by people snapping the first class alternative, and then applying a filter to make the lobster look even more delicious. Sometime you can't complain though, and getting a meal, whatever it is like, can brighten your flight. Instagram: Colourful and tasty food awaits the intrepid explorer, sampling a slice of culture on their holidays . Reality: Sometimes it is safer to eat at the hotel if you aren't sure what animal it is that is being served at the side of the street . It is great to want to experience as much of another culture as you can while you are there for your visit. Immersing yourself in the local markets and sampling the cuisine can seem like a good place to start. While a lot of tasty delicacies can be found, you will inevitably stumble upon a questionable dish at some stage, that will make you crave something safer. Instagram: Pop star Rihanna gets up close and personal with a giraffe at a zoo . Reality: Sometimes the encounter is too close for comfort if you are lucky enough to approach an animal in an enclosure . Getting to see animals close up at the zoo is rare on a busy day. However if you do have an encounter with the animals, you could be hoping for an experience like Rihanna's, who met a giraffe and posted a snap on her Instagram account. Sadly sometimes the animals have other ideas and you can be faced with a less than dignified situation. Instagram: Girl group The Saturdays posted this photo of their tour bus, which has plush leather interiors and flat-screen televisions . Reality: Waiting in a queue of tired explorers, wondering who you will be sat next to, and praying your seat is not next to the toilet . Celebrities make transport seem easy, with luxurious tour buses or limousines waiting to take them to their next destination. For the rest of us, public coaches can be the cheapest way to reach our holidays. Sadly stretching out with flat screen TVs is not the norm in this case. Instagram: An exotic shot of the famous pyramids while sat on a camel for an authentic desert feel . Reality: Take a short trip from the bustling city to see the landmarks, or see it from Pizza Hut, which is located nearby . It is easy to give the impression of a long camel ride to the pyramids in Egypt. What some people don't realise is they are actually located just on the edge of the busy city. Furthermore, a Pizza Hut is located across from pyramids in Giza.",

A Hungarian man has been convicted of luring young, gay Eastern European men to the United States for a horrific life of sex slavery. Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering felonies this week after grooming fellow Hungarians online then keeping them captive in New York City and Miami. Vass brought men to America with the promises of easy work and high wages - then took their travel documents, threatened their families, and made them spend 20 hours a day on sex work, prosecutors said. He was found guilty of the offences by a jury in Miami-Dade on Thursday, the Miami Herald reported. He faces a maximum sentence of 155 years in prison - and will spend at least 21 behind bars. Three of Vass's victims testified against him at the trial. Two said they were tempted to the United States after being contacted via Planet Romeo, a free dating site. According Gay Star News, the men believed they would be employed as legal escorts and make between $3,000 and $5,000 a month. The victims said they were flown to New York City in 2012 and forced to live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. They were forced to perform sex work at all hours, either in person or live on webcams. Lure: Prosecutors said at least two of the victims were lured to America via the Planet Romeo gay dating website . According to online listings, Vass's company, Never Sleep Inc., was based at an address in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in New York City. In August 2012, prosecutors said, the Vass and his associates moved the business to Miami. Vass is accused of running the sex ring with two other men, Gabor Acs and Viktor Berki, who have yet to stand trial. Victims said that they had their passports taken when they arrived and that Berki, a former policeman, threatened their families in Hungary. Vass is due to be sentenced on June 2.",

She was set to go to trial in Multnomah County Circuit Court this week, but prosecutors dropped the charge on Monday because Curtin, 23, was 'completely justified in her outrage'. Elena Curtin of Portland, Oregon, was seven-months pregnant when she was charged with second-degree assault after she struck her boyfriend's ex in the head and arm with a crowbar in November 2014 . Curtin gave birth in January. When Curtin came home, she found her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend shooting heroin while sitting on her toilet, Oregonian/OregonLive reported. When she asked her to leave and the woman refused, Curtin beat her with a crowbar. Oregon law allows for use of physical force against an intruder who won't leave a resident's home. Curtin's defense attorney, Casey Kovacic, said the ex-girlfriend was 'jealous and bitter' that the boyfriend was in a relationship with his client. The boyfriend, who is the father of Curtin's child, struggled with heroin in the past. The ex and the boyfriend had gotten high at the apartment before and they have a five-year-old child. They have since reconciled and Curtin is now living with her parents. The boyfriend has not been a part of his new child's life. Kovacic wrote in an email: 'In the two years leading up to this incident, [the ex] made it her personal mission to make Elena's life miserable. 'She routinely harassed and threatened to hurt Elena, stole from her, and cruelly plotted to drag [the boyfriend] back into addiction. 'That's one silver lining - she's [Curtin] been able to examine how bad (her relationship) was and move on with her life.' If she had gone to trial and been convicted, Curtin would have faced received a mandatory prison sentence of almost six years. Curtin was charged after coming home and finding her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend shooting heroin in her bathroom .",

    "document": "Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud, also known by aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, is the mastermind of Thursday's Kenya university terror attack, according to a tweet from the country's Interior Ministry. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a \"Most Wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\" Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack . Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

Heartwarming: One of the cubs clambers on to the mother's back, with water from their dip in the lake clearly visible as they enjoy the sunshine . The bear family are part of a huge population found in the Kronotsky Reserve - known as the Kingdom of bears - thanks to its huge population of the animals. The bears are guarded by the state to prevent illegal poaching and hunting - meaning the bears are more friendly towards humans without the threat of violence. 'Though we should understand that bears are very dangerous animals, with them being probably one of the most unpredictable and emotionless creatures, the bears here are pretty friendly.

    "document": "Incredible footage has emerged of a mysterious pair of white lights seen hovering perilously close to to the Chilean volcano eruption. Volcano Calbuco, which has laid dormant for more than 40 years, suddenly erupted on Wednesday causing a thick plume of ash to cloud the sky while thousands of people living in its shadow were forced to flee the 'apocalypse-like' event. Hundreds filmed the eruption, near the southern port city of Puerto Montt, Chile, and its deadly ash cloud which caused all nearby flights to be grounded for safety. But one amateur cameraman was surprised to see what appeared to be white lights close to the enormous plume of ash and smoke rising from the mouth of the volcano. Scroll down for video . Mysterious white lights have been spotted hovering near Chile's erupting Calbuco volcano on Wednesday . A pair of strange glowing white lights were filmed floating perilously close to the smoke and gas clouds from the eruption . The pictures have since gone viral with internet user suggesting the lights were either police helicopters, an optical illusion or an alien aircraft . The footage shows the unexplained pair of lights floating dangerous close to erupting volcano before disappearing. Tens of thousands of people have speculated on what the UFO could be, suggesting everything from police or emergence services helicopters, to a kind of optical illusion or even an alien craft. One YouTube user, Perkoff, believed it was time travelers. He wrote: 'Most UFOs are not aliens like a lot of people think. They are in fact time machines from the future. The reason you see so many UFOs at historic events is because people from the future want to come back in time and witness history. A lot of these UFOs are filled with students and are just going on a futuristic version of a field trip.' Bud Ekins wrote: 'It wants to be filmed! Drones and planes don't disappear like that.' Others argues it was something a little more mundane. One YouTube user wrote: 'For me, chances are it's a drone.' While Francisco Javier Segurasaid: 'It's a airplane, come on! Up in smoke: Volcano Calbuco, in southern Chile, has erupted forcing 1,500 residents from Ensenada, about 10 miles away, to flee their homes (pictured, a view of the eruption from Puerto Montt, a small city around 20 miles from the volcano) Smoke and lava can be seen spewing from the Calbuco volcano in this picture taken from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas . An electrical storm lights up the night sky as a huge column of ash and lava shoots out of the volcano. The eruption sparked a red alert in the port city of Puerto Montt . Volcano Calbuco, believed to be among the three most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes, had erupted for the first time at 6pm local time on Wednesday. An estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of Ensenada after the eruption, while several smaller townships were also cleared. Experts said the main risk was now now of a pyroclastic flow - a superheated current of gas and rock that can destroy nearly everything in its path and travel at speeds upwards of 200 to 300 kilometers per hour. Gabriel Orozco, a vulcanologist with Chile’s geological and mining service, said: “In this situation, with the eruption column so high, the main risk is that it collapses, falls due to gravity because of its own weight and causes a pyroclastic flow,” . Locals described an apocalyptic scene as ash clouds were shot six miles into the air creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region yesterday heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is located near the tourist town of Puerto Varas and the city of Puerto Montt, a little more than 620 miles south of Chile's capital, Santiago. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano, barring access to the area. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some six miles from the volcano, said the eruption happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Dusted: A car covered in ash at the Ensenada locality, on the outskirts of Calbuco volcano . Ghost town: Most people have abandoned the La Ensenada locality in Puerto Varas (pictured) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at Calbuco volcano . Boats dusted with volcanic ash deposited from the eruptions of the looming Calbuco volcano, background, sit parked in front of a home . Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Unexpected: The volcano last erupted in 1972, and while it is widely believed to be among Chile's most dangerous, it was not under observation before it erupted today (the eruption pictured from Puerto Varas) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas go about their business while in the background the ash cloud from Volcano Calbuco is seen . Green fields: The scene looked calm away from the fall out from the ash, but southern Chile remains on alert .",

But in fact, the group of tourists were exploring the activities on offer in the country's Napo Province, in the Amazon rainforest. The publicity stunt saw the tourists enjoy white water rafting, swimming near waterfalls and hiking, but it seems that Costa Rica was not amused by the ruse. The creative prank was executed by the Ecuadorean airline Tame, Ecuador's Tourism Ministry and Ministry of Transport and Public Works . The unusual video sparked a diplomatic incident, with the Costa Rican government and Ambassador to Ecuador complaining to the authorities and resulting in Ecuador issuing an apology. The creative project was executed by the Ecuadorean airline Tame, Ecuador's Tourism Ministry and Ministry of Transport and Public Works. But the stunt sparked outrage from the Costa Rican Tourism Institute, the presidential palace and the Foreign Ministry. As Ecuador residents arrived, not in Costa Rica but another Ecuador airport, Tena, where they were given fake stamps in their passports as they went through a staged passport control. No attention to detail was spared as huge posters were placed over the welcome billboards at the airport. Adverts depicting Imperial beer and 'Esencial Costa Rica,' Costa Rica's national brand, were displayed in the airport to throw the group off the scent. Even fictitious immigration documents and car licence plates were created to make the group think they were in Golfito, a port town in Costa Rica. On top of all that organisers used mobile phone and GPS blockers to keep passengers from using technology to discover the hoax. The Tame airline staged the prank in a bid to demonstrate that Ecuador should be considered a top tourist destination . A fake passport control was set up, which even gave out fake stamps for passports . The unsuspecting tourists took part in a number of exciting activities, from white water rafting to hiking . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down. 'We're unhappy about their use of our country to trick their people into getting to know their own country,' Costa Rican tourism minister Wilhelm von Breymann told The Tico Times. The trip aimed to show citizens that Ecuador can be a great tourist destination, featuring many incredible site like the breathtaking volcanic crater lake, Quilotoa . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down . In a note posted on the foreign ministry's website, the government stated:' The Costa Rican government expressed its discomfort at the use of its image in publicity about Ecuadorean tourism. 'The Ambassador Alejandro Solado spoke with the highest Ecuadorian authorities about the display in the publicity video and the South American country will take the post down from the Internet.' The Ecuadorain Ambassador Ricardo Patino then followed up with an apology to Costa Rica and confirmed Ecuador had sent a letter to the government to settle the matter. Although they were previously considering legal action, they have since accepted the apology, La Nación reported. Costa Rican outlet La Nación uploaded it on YouTube where it has been viewed by 60,000 people. At the end of the trip, the organiser tore down an 'Esencial Costa Rica' banner that had been posted at the airport to throw the group off the scent. This revealed the Ecuadorean tourism slogan: 'love life' Tame, the largest airline of Ecuador, was part of the big-scale prank, and helped the tourism group to fool the visitors .",

    "document": "Richie Benaud spent a lifetime in the sun and in his final years he ruefully admitted that he was paying the price for it with skin cancers on his forehead and the top of his head. The 84-year-old, who died on Friday, talked about his cancer and the treatment he was undergoing with typical candour. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap,' Benaud told the Nine Network about growing up in Australia in the 1930s and 40s. 'I wish I had. You live and learn as you go along.' The cricket commentary box legend talked about the radiation treatment he was receiving for his skin cancer. Benaud, who hadn't returned to his commentary job for the Nine Network following a car accident in October 2013 in which he suffered serious injuries, had looked increasingly frail and had lost weight. But he had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne for 40 minutes every morning, in the hope that he could return to work. Scroll down for video . Skin cancer: Richie Benaud, pictured at the SCG in January 2013, revealed late last year that he had skin cancer and was receiving radiation treatment, admitting that 'as a kid we never ever wore a cap' but using the opportunity to advise all Australians to cover their heads . Marvellous: Richie Benaud, pictured in 1961 in Britain when he was captaining the Test series, admitted last year that he had never worn head gear as a young player because he had been influence by legendary all rounder Keith Miller, saying 'when I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap ... that's because Keith Miller never wore a cap' 'Master of the microphone': Cricket fans pictured applauding Richie Benaud as he covered his last match on English soil at The Oval in London, the Ashes Test between England and Australia in 2005 . Super effort: A victorious Australian captain Richie Benaud leads his team from the field at Old Trafford in 1961 after winning the Ashes in the fourth Test against England in which he sensationally took five wickets for 13 runs in 25 balls, instigating England's collapse . 'Morning everybody': Richie Benaud commentated cricket for more than four decades following a stellar career as a Test cricketer during which he batted, bowled and captained Australia from the late 1950s to his retirement in 1964 . Benaud had been driving his beloved car - a 1963 Sunbeam Alpine - back from hitting practice golf balls at the Australian Golf Club in Sydney when he lost control and hit a parked car and then a small brick fence. He was hospitalised with shoulder, spinal and chest injuries and a broken sternum. He was subsequently diagnosed with skin cancer and began treatment last year, revealing that doctors were pleased with his progress. He told reporters last November he was 'coping with it very well'. The cricket legend said he believed the cancers were caused by playing cricket in the sun without a hat or sunscreen. Long history behind the microphone: Richie Benaud looks on during the fifth test match between England and Australia in August 1989, wearing one of his trademark light-coloured jackets which were his signature along with his unique commentary .

What a catch: Richie Benaud, pictured with his beloved wife, Daphne, at Randwick racecourse in 2007, said that following a serious car crash and then treatment for skin cancer he and Daphne had been walking for '40 minutes a day' to ease him back to good health in the hope he could return to the commentary box . The former Australian test cricketer seized on the opportunity to encourage Australians to protect themselves from the sun. 'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads,' he said. 'Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to.' He said he was still recovering from the car accident injuries which included two fractured vertebrae. However, he expressed the belief he would make a return to cover the fourth Test against India at the SCG in Sydney, and had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne every morning in an effort to regain his health.

Legend among legends: Benaud at the SCG with fellow cricketers turned commentators Ian Healey, Michael Slater, Brett Lee, Ian Chappell and Bill Lawry dressed in pink for McGrath Foundation day during the Sydney test between Australia and Sri Lanka in January 2013 . 'Progress is slow,' he said. 'I've been doing a lot of walking. 'We are out every morning, doing 40-minute walks every morning and it's showing beneficial effects.' Without the information on skin cancer danger now available during his playing days, Benaud revealed he was influenced by the example of great all rounder Keith Miller. 'When I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap - not a flash one,' Benaud said. 'That's because Keith Miller never wore a cap. Arthur Morris did when he went out to bat. 'We follow various people and 'Nugget' Miller never wore anything on his head, so I didn't. 'I wish I had.'

    "document": "(CNN)Be afraid -- be very afraid. This is the warning the world deserves to hear. Because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century: the fruits of radical Islam. The results of the Obama White House's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical Islam in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. Not to mention here in the United States, Canada and Europe. Is it not a tragic irony that the Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater while leaving Libya a failed state and Yemen a failing state? The Syrian jihad gave rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which now uses Syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in Iraq, which could soon spill over into Jordan. Plus, Libya is now being used as a rear operating base by ISIS and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the Middle East, even as they plan attacks in Europe and North America. Given the frightfully slow pace America's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both ISIS and its progenitor, al Qaeda, the picture of what's in store is clear: The body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas. And neither the United States nor our Western allies are immune to this cancer. Academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of ISIS and al Qaeda as distinctly different. But the fact is they are not -- their agendas, which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today, are manifestations of radical Islam. Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven naïve, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is, but as they hope it could be. There is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world's most powerful politician and his national security team. Just take the National Strategy for Counterterrorism published by the White House in 2011. That document contained the assertion that, \"Since the beginning of 2011, the transformative change sweeping North Africa and the Middle East -- along with the death of Osama bin Laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat, par-ticularly as the relevance of al Qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished.\" Yet, fast forward to January 2014 and America's top intelligence official, director of National Intelligence James Clapper, advised Congress that al Qaeda was no less capable of threatening the United States and our allies than a decade earlier. Soon after Clapper acknowledged al Qaeda was not a band on the run, as President Obama had described the terrorist enterprise, a report by terrorism expert Seth Jones of the RAND Corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the White House: As restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like Libya, Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring, those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al Qaeda and groups aligned with it. According to data compiled by Jones, from 2010 through 2013, the number of Salafi jihadist groups increased by 58%. These groups are fueled by Salafiyya Jihadiyya, an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al Qaeda, but is the source code for the agenda of the al Qaeda offshoot ISIS. Most recently, absent from the National Security Strategy produced by the Obama White House in February 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al Qaeda. Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed on President Obama's watch. But contrary to what the White House seemed to think in 2011, bin Laden's death has not lifted the shadow he casts over America's, or our allies' security. Indeed, within days of our new National Security Strategy's publication date, in the seventh issue of ISIS's English-language magazine Dabiq, the group's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin Laden, while accusing his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, of steering al Qaeda off the path of its former leader. Meanwhile, Yemen -- home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the al Qaeda branch that claimed credit for the January 2015 attack in Paris at the office of Charlie Hebdo -- has also become a failed state. AQAP is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al Qaeda writ large, and the Obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al Qaeda's global network. So it is interesting that, in the months before the Yemeni government was overthrown by Iran-backed rebels, President Obama described the U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al Qaeda -- interesting because the President did not do more to help that \"partner\" government remain in power. Once again, the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the Middle East. What were they thinking? And how do they plan to combat AQAP now? Despite what the White House wants the world to believe, a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities: . ISIS controls a large amount of territory in the Middle East, and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as Libya and Afghanistan, while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the West. And, although ISIS is trying to \"out al Qaeda\" al Qaeda, resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world, al Qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the United States and our allies today than it was in January 2014. At the same time, the routine failures of President Obama and his advisers to understand the security environment, and to appropriately tailor America's national security posture in a manner demanded by it, foretells more disasters lie ahead. Not only Americans, but also our allies should be very, very afraid. Indeed, President Obama's refusal to simply call a problem like radical Islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical Islamist groups. History has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders don't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it. President Obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that. But if he wants to help define a future for the Middle East and North Africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions, he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes-men surrounding him at the White House. There is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with Pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe. Indeed, President Obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from Arab states are saying behind closed doors. Most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating ISIS and al Qaeda. However, all of them recognize that, unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better, the United States will have to deploy considerably more of our \"kinetic\" resources to put those victories in sight. This does not mean a ground forces-intensive response is required from us at this time. But if the President thinks it prudent to wait on our Arab partners to do most of the heavy lifting, he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not-too-distant future.",

In a statement, the department said the change is being made as part of its constant effort to ensure \"accountability, professionalism and transparency... at the forefront of our day-to-day activities.\" As police departments around the country see more protests over the use of lethal force, IMPD officials acknowledge that this is a time of \"increased scrutiny of police operations and tactics,\" but said the decision to change the uniform for certain ranks within the department is \"not related to any specific, individual incident occurring elsewhere in the United States.\" Although it's not a total uniform makeover, police officials said the white shirts will make command-level staff immediately identifiable to those who don't recognize the rank badges on officers' collars, the statement said. The new color will be worn by majors, district commanders, deputy chiefs, assistant chiefs and the chief of police. \"Command staff personnel have the responsibility of publicly leading from the front, while being accessible to the members of the general public they serve,\" the statement said. \"Those wearing white uniform shirts can and should be viewed as the final point of contact to the police department.\" Some studies have shown that while any police uniform is usually perceived by the public as a sign of authority, lighter-colored uniforms may give a sense of goodness and safety.",

    "document": "George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from £10,000 to £12,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority, he said. At present anyone earning between £31,866 to £150,000 is taxed at the higher rate. Those earning above £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to £50,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum, is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP, who want to break up the country, is deeply disturbing.' He added the Scottish nationalist leaders were 'much stronger' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together. 'That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the Union but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.' He also accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' by not agreeing to a debate with him and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury. The Chancellor accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' of a debate on the economy with himself and Danny Alexander .",

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night.

    "document": "A mysterious ‘warm blob’ of water off the West coast of the US could explain why states like California are experiencing their worst ever drought, while the East is battered by freezing weather. The blob in the ocean was discovered last year, with temperatures one to four degrees Celsius (two to seven degrees Fahrenheit) above surrounding ‘normal’ water. And the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles (1,600km) offshore, from Mexico up to Alaska, and could herald a warmer summer for some regions. Scroll down for video . A 'blob' of warm water 2,000 miles across is sitting in the Pacific Ocean (shown in diagram). Since last June it has extended from Alaska to Mexico. It has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere. And a new University of Washington study says it could be responsible for droughts . A new study by the University of Washington found that a high-pressure ridge could be causing the blob, by trapping heat in the water. In June of last year, the huge patch of water stretched 1,000 miles (1,600km) in each direction, and was 300ft (90 metres) deep. Dr Nick Bond, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, coined the term ‘the blob’ in June. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. Ten months later, the blob is now squashed up against the coast, and Dr Bond says all models point to it continuing through the end of this year. ‘In the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big, almost circular mass of water that just didn't cool off as much as it usually did, so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year,’ said Dr Bond. Researchers said it may have contributed to the state of Washington's mild 2014 winter and might signal a warmer summer. But exactly how this area of warmer water has formed, or how long it will stay, remains a mystery. One thing that can be studied, though, is its effects. As air passes over warmer water and reaches the coast it brings more heat and less snow, which the scientists say helped cause current drought conditions in California, Oregon and Washington. The researchers said that it might not only be causing warmer temperatures on the West coast, but also cooler temperatures on the East coast. It could also be playing a part in circulating cold and wet air to the central and eastern states of the US. California's drought (stock image shown left) is one of the worst on record, while the East coast of the US (Central Park in New York shown right) has seen unusually cold temperatures . It is also having an effect on marine life. Fish have been spotted in unusual places, supporting recent reports that West coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm, less nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water. Dr Bond noted that, while this phenomenon likely wasn’t caused by global warming, it could be a sign of similar weather to come. ‘This is a taste of what the ocean will be like in future decades,’ Dr Bond said. ‘It wasn't caused by global warming, but it's producing conditions that we think are going to be more common with global warming.’ The 'blob' is also having an effect on marine life. Fish, like the Thresher Shark (shown), have been spotted in unusual places, supporting recent reports that West Coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm, less nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water .",

    "document": "Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten, it can be revealed. Ukip, which will today unveil its manifesto, has reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Nigel Farage has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten . South Thanet, Kent (Majority: Con 7,617) Clacton, Essex (Ukip 12,404) Rochester & Strood, Kent (Ukip 2,920) Thurrock, Essex (Con 92) Great Grimsby, Lincs (Labour 714) Boston & Skegness, Lincs (Con 12,426) Camborne & Redruth, Cornwall (Con 66) Dudley North, West Midlands (Lab 649) Castle Point, Essex (Cons 7,632) Heywood & Middleton, Greater Manchester (Lab 617) After Ukip won the Rochester and Strood by-election last November and gained its second MP, Mr Farage said the party could go on to win 'dozens of seats' in the election. But Ukip campaign chiefs have now adopted a 'shotgun' approach with a far fewer targets. Mr Farage will this morning launch the party's manifesto in Thurrock, Essex. A Ukip source said: 'It will be a broad and open offer to those on low and middle incomes. That's something which no other party is doing.' Among the seats dropped from the list of hopefuls is Folkestone and Hythe, where candidate Janice Atkinson was replaced after allegations of fraudulent expenses claims. The target list includes South Thanet, where Mr Farage is standing, along with Clacton and Rochester and Strood, where Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless won by-elections after defecting from the Tories. The party also hopes to win in Thurrock, a tight three-way marginal where the Tories are defending a majority of just 92. Another focus is Heywood and Middleton, in Greater Manchester, where it narrowly lost a by-election to Labour last October. Ukip's election co-ordinator Chris Bruni-Lowe, who masterminded last year's by-election wins, is organising campaigns in the ten targets. The party is helping write campaign literature, organising mailshots to voters and putting up billboards, while other candidates are mostly being left to their own devices. Clacton, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell (left) is standing for Ukip, is one of the few seats the party still thinks he can win . Ukip's immigration spokesman has admitted that even the leadership of the party has been left confused by its policy on foreigners moving to Britain. At an event last month Steven Woolfe said the deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who has written Ukip's manifesto, did not understand the immigration policy even when he showed her diagrams to explain it. It is claimed that Mr Woolfe, who was speaking after a meeting in Dudley, said: 'The problem is, even within my own party, my own deputy chairman, didn't seem to understand it herself despite the fact I actually put picture graphs. 'I put the numbers on and the point is people confuse immigration. Immigration consists of loads of different numbers, the number of students, it's asylum seekers, it's family members.' Nigel Farage was earlier this month accused of 'making up his policies as he goes along' after he called for the number of arrivals to be limited at 50,000 a year, but at the same time claimed overall caps on net migration would be 'ludicrous'. Miss Evans this morning said the manifesto would include an immigration limit of 50,000 skilled workers from around the world, adding she was 'proud' of the policy. Most pollsters suggest Ukip is being squeezed, with an ICM poll suggesting the party had slipped to 7 per cent on Monday, while a poll by Opinium at the weekend put the party on a two-year low. Mr Farage has maintained that the party is not losing support but appears to have changed his rhetoric, referring to the election as a 'springboard'. In an interview at the weekend he suggested Ukip supporters should vote Tory in seats where the party has no chance of winning. A senior Ukip source last night said Mr Farage could begin discussions with the Tories about a post-election deal through 'back-channels' before the polls close. Mr Farage 'is minded to do confidence-and-supply with whoever offers an EU referendum', he said. Ukip's manifesto will include a pledge to fund 6,000 jobs in the police, prison service and Border Agency for military veterans. And Mr Farage is today expected to pledge that his party would spend 'substantially' more than Nato's target of 2 per cent of national income on defence. He has previously said that Ukip would meet the target. The Tories have refused to commit to the target beyond next year. In a bid to bolster faltering opinion poll ratings, Mr Farage said Ukip was offering 'serious, fully costed policies' aimed at voters who 'believe' in Britain. An in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership 'as soon as possible', a five-year ban on unskilled migrants coming in to the UK and a points-based system for others are among other key pledges. With the party keen to broaden its appeal after a slip in support after surging to victory in last year's European elections, the manifesto also offers boosts for first-time buyers, military veterans, small businesses and hospital patients.",

The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of £17,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of £675 and a victim surcharge of £50. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.'

Football star: Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club . She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised £10,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of £17,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than £10,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it. I never realised how many people have been through what we have been through because at times I thought I was the only one.'",

In an interview to promote her role as Mulberry’s new muse, trained dancer Miss Bonas - who also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine for the April edition - said: ‘I’m a strong, independent woman' Mulberry has released a short film featuring Miss Bonas, 26, dancing round an old court house and English country garden in a £1,800 dress (pictured). Miss Bonas dated Prince Harry for two years until last April . The three-night production was put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, of which Harry’s sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, is patron. Indeed, Prince Harry even attended the opening night of his former girlfriend’s play, and was heard laughing loudly throughout. Last month, she also appeared on the front cover of Miss Vogue magazine, and later this year will make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring Dame Judi Dench. ‘I hope the focus is becoming more about skills that I have,’ she said in the interview with the Sunday Time’s Style magazine. ‘It’s really important to me not just to be known as…’ she added, drifting off without finishing the sentence, presumably referring to being known as Prince Harry’s ex. She refused to discuss her relationship with the prince, only to comment on the media attention their romance prompted. ‘All that stuff is not real,’ she says. ‘It’s really important to remember that all it is is noise, noise that can be very loud at times.’ Miss Bonas is set to make her film debut in Harvey Weinstein’s Tulip Fever, also starring Dame Judi Dench . She has just finished playing Cecily in The Importance of Being Ernest at the London Oratory, the Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg’s son as a pupil. Pictured: Miss Bonas in Mulberry's short video . She said she survived the attention, and speculation about their impending engagement, by being a homebody. ‘I’m not really one of those people who’s always out. I like being at home. I suppose that helps. I’ll go out with my friends or if there’s something really amazing I have been invited to, but I won’t do that all the time because that is not who I am.’ ‘But if I ever feel like “Oh, my life” or get upset by silly things like a photographer, or if someone has written something nasty that upsets me, I just think “worse things happen at sea”,’ she added, quoting her mother, Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon’s, favourite saying. Lady Mary-Gaye, the daughter of the 6th Earl Howe, has been married four times and has five children. The blonde, 1960s socialite once posed for a coffee table book half naked and smothered in engine oil and even had a cocktail named after her at Claridge’s. 'I hope the focus is becoming more about the skills I have,' said Miss Bonas, 26, of the shift she hopes will now happen in terms of how the media and members of the public see her now that she is pursuing an acting career . Miss Bonas pictured with her former partner Prince Harry in March last year just a month before they split up . Miss Bonas is Lady Mary’s only child with from her third marriage to Jeffrey Bonas, an old Harrovian entrepreneur. Speaking about her family, Miss Bonas said she was a ‘lion’. ‘It really, really annoys me when people attack my mum, because all of it’s all false. All of it,’ she said. ‘With all of her children, whenever we have a problem or a drama, she’s always there, as a mother but also as a friend who gives really wise advice. ‘About my family, I’m a lion. I am not tough but I am strong. I am definitely not a wallflower.’",

    "document": "SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' In September's vote, 55 per cent of Scots backed the idea of remaining in the United Kingdom. Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'",

    "document": "Tommy Connolly hadn't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on Facebook out of the blue in December. The 23-year-old Sunshine Coast University student was enjoying semester break and training hard in the hope of one day representing Australia as a champion sprinter. He messaged his 17-year-old cousin Angela* (name has been changed for legal reasons) to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless, illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant. Mr Connolly picked her up from where she was sleeping rough on the Gold Coast, let her move into his flat, took care of her through the final stage of her pregnancy and is now helping to raise her four-week-old baby boy. Tommy Connolly, a 23-year-old Sunshine Coast University student, took in his homeless, pregnant 17-year-old cousin and his helping her raise her four-week-old baby boy . The 23-year-old Sunshine Coast University student says he didn't think twice about helping her . 'I went and picked her up and she basically started telling me about her situation, which was hard for me to hear because she was my favourite little cousin when I was growing up,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'To my knowledge she was OK... but in reality she wasn't at all. 'Basically she was living on the streets, she became addicted to ice and was doing terrible things to get by. She didn't have anything.' Mr Connolly said Angela – whose last year of schooling was Year Six – had stopped taking hard drugs by the time she was 15 but at 16 she fell pregnant, and her baby's father was sent to prison soon afterward. By the time Mr Connolly met up with her she was 32 weeks pregnant, and he said he didn't think twice about taking her in. 'It's not her fault she's just a little girl who needed help,' he said. Angela (not her real name) added Mr Connolly on Facebook after they hadn't seen each other in 10 years . 'Obviously I'm not going to let her stay on the streets. 'Everyone likes to tell me this is such a big responsibility, but I wasn't thinking about uni or work or anything, all I was doing was thinking that she needed me.' Because Mr Connolly was on university holidays at the time he had been working full time in his job at a fruit and vegetable wholesaler and he had saved $2800, just enough to cover the cost of moving into a new house and buying items for the baby. He put his athletics training on hold so he could work enough hours to save money, but he returned to university as normal at the beginning of March because he didn't want to delay his studies. Mr Connolly (pictured in the U.S. while studying there in 2013) still studies and works three days per week to support the three of them . When Angela gave birth to her baby Joshua* (name has been changed) on March 17, he was finishing off university assignments due the next day in the hospital waiting room. 'I went into uni the day after, I hadn't slept but I needed to do a presentation,' he said. Now that Joshua is four weeks old, Mr Connolly continues to go to class and is working three days per week to support the three of them. And while many other 23-year-olds would rather be spending their spare time partying with friends or travelling, he says he doesn't mind the impact that looking after Angela and Joshua is having on his social life. 'My closest mates are from training, so they're athletes, and they don't go out all the time,' he said. 'Most of the time they work, train and study, so I'm around a good crew of people.' His brother Liam has started a GoFundMe fundraising page in an effort to make Mr Connolly, Angela and Joshua's financial situation more stable. Mr Connolly said that, since sharing his story online, he has been getting messages from people all over Australia congratulating him for what he is doing. The champion sprinter says he doesn't mind the impact of his social life, as most of his friends are athletes and don't spend their spare time partying . 'I know what I've done is a really good thing but I feel guilty I'm getting all this attention,' he said. 'We've had all these messages which has made us realise there are so many other people in this situation, I don't want people to think it's a unique thing. 'I can't believe how many people have been in these shoes before, and have had no help or support when they were pregnant.' Mr Connolly added that he wasn't worried about how his situation would affect his plans to start his own family one day. 'Growing up everyone thinks about that stuff but you can't control that sort of stuff, it's not something that came into my head,' he said. 'At first when Joshua came into the world I didn't have an emotional attachment, all I was doing was looking after Angela. 'But I really do care for him and in a way he is my kid, I've taken on the father role as you'd imagine. 'Angela does 90 per cent of the work – and if it's one or two years of my life I have to put on hold to make sure two lives are going to be saved it's nothing at all.' 'If it's one or two years of my life I have to put on hold to make sure two lives are going to be saved it's nothing at all,' said Mr Connolly, pictured with his friend and fellow athlete Olivia Tauro .",

    "document": "NHS bosses have today come under fire after it emerged a hospital paid a temporary nurse £2,200 to cover a single 12-hour shift. The figure, which equates to £183 an hour, was paid by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. It represents double the rate for a neurologist and was revealed following a Freedom of Information request. It also emerged there were 47 agency nurses working at the trust in December last year. The trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, has been criticised for wasting taxpayers' money. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust paid £2,200 to a temporary nurse for one 12-hour shift to help amid a shortage of trained nurses, a Freedom of Information request revealed (file picture) Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be aghast at the cost of just one shift. 'Agency nurses are far more expensive than their regular counterparts and we have to minimise the number used. 'You can't open a newspaper without hearing how tight finances are in the NHS, but the service has to become far more efficient with the money it already has.' Edmund Stubbs, from independent think tank Civitas, added: 'It is evident that a lack of staff is leading to excessive spending on agency staff, locums and overseas recruitment.' A spokesman for the trust said the £2,200 figure includes VAT, adding that the true figure paid to the nurse, including travel expenses, was £1,864. The shift covered was one in specialist Intensive Therapy Unit on a Bank Holiday. Defending their spending, Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She highlighted their situation is one shared by many hospitals across the UK. She added: 'We have said consistently that we want to recruit more nurses to reduce our reliance on agency and temporary staff and this has been widely publicised with a number of recruitment events taking place recently to attract new staff. 'We have recruited, or made offers to, more than 150 staff nurses and health care assistants in recent months as part of our efforts to recruit more nursing staff to support our wards and departments. Defending the spend Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at the trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She said in recent months the hospitals have recruited more than 150 nurses and healthcare assistants . 'These new recruits have included a number who have been offered positions through a successful nursing recruitment event at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital just last week, which we will repeat again on Thursday. 'We’ll continue our efforts to ensure that over the coming months we will see fewer agency nurses on our wards as our new starters get settled in, which will mean better continuity of care and more support for ward teams.' Figures obtained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also revealed nearly a third of nursing recruits in the UK had to be sought abroad last year. NHS spending on temporary staff has rocketed to a staggering £2.5 billion a year because of a chronic shortage of British nurses. The number of foreign nurses and midwives registered in the past 12 months grew to 8,200, up from just 6,200 a year earlier. Around 7,500 came from the EU - particularly Spain, Italy and Portugal - with others came from further afield, including the Philippines. It also emerged that 29 per cent of new nurses were recruited from abroad in the past 12 months, compared to 11 per cent five years ago.",

    "document": "The time is around 9pm on a Thursday and 7,000 people are chanting ‘YES! YES! YES!’ in a pitch-black car park in London’s Docklands. It’s been raining and the ground is damp, but we are all in our bare feet, which are going numb on the cold, hard concrete. Undeterred, we keep going. There’s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat. Marianne Power attended Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminarwhich claims to ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want' The mood is tribal. I feel as if we’re on our way to a ritual killing. Maybe our own. We’ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in ‘physical or emotional injury, paralysis, death . . .’ and we’ve spent the past half-an-hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation. I feel sick with anticipation, but there’s no way out — the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward. Then, the chanting stops and a hush fills the air. We are faced with our fate. It glimmers grey and red in the darkness: lanes of burning hot coals, which we are to walk over. Yes, actually walk over — with our bare feet. We have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment — being whipped into something called ‘peak state’, a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything. The idea is that, once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 Fahrenheit, you can ‘conquer the other fires of your life with ease’. But I don’t conquer anything with ease. It’s not in my nature. ‘Am I really doing this?’ is all I can think. But yes, I am. For the past year, I’ve been on a self-improvement mission. Fed up with a life spent worrying, single and broke, I’ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month. Marianne (pictured) has set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month and this month she chose that of Anthony Robbins . And, when it comes to the self-improvement world, Anthony Robbins is the king. Everyone from world leaders — Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev — to athletes such as Serena Williams and actors including Hugh Jackman seek his counsel. He even helped Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. His IS a classic rags-to-riches story. Determined to transcend his poor childhood, he became obsessed with self-improvement. He’d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor, before going on to give motivational talks himself. Fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man, whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars. He charges $1 million to coach private clients — which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall. Anthony Robbins (pictured in the 1990s) charges $1 million to coach private clients and is the 'king' of the self-improvement world . According to his website, Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminar would help me ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want, break through any barriers that might be holding you back, increase your energy and mental clarity, and infuse passion into your life’. Big promises. But the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver. She has been three times before, she tells me. ‘When you walk over those coals, something changes,’ she says, her eyes wide. ‘I can’t explain it, but it’s just amazing.’ She has all the fervour of a fanatic. Two physiotherapists from Windsor join in our conversation — they’ve been sent here by their boss. ‘He went last year and got a lot out of it,’ they say. ‘He was on a high for weeks.’ And ‘high’ is the perfect word for the atmosphere. As we file into the arena, there’s chaos as people rush to get good seats — but no one sits in them. They’re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers. It’s like being at a One Direction concert. After half-an-hour, Tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale. People can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man. With his Hollywood tan, white teeth and lantern jaw, he looks like something that a Mills & Boon writer would dream up. And just to add to the effect, his chiselled face is blown up to God-like proportions on massive screens behind him. It takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak — but when he starts, he doesn’t stop. His basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state. He says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then ‘the impossible just gets done’. He is the King of the Catchphrase: ‘It’s impossible to love yourself when you’re not being yourself’; ‘Change your story, change your life . . .’ These nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm. He doesn’t take a tea break and neither do we. It’s extraordinary — I’ve never seen anything like it. Just the sheer energy of him. I find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential, then I realise I’m swooning. Even world leaders like Nelson Mandela (left) and Bill Clinton (right) have sought the advice and counsel of Anthony Robbins . I turn to the Norwegian man next to me and say: ‘I think I’m in love . . .’ He smiles and says: ‘Me, too.’ We are all under his spell and will do anything he says, including hugging and high-fiving strangers, and punching our fists in the air while yelling: ‘Yes, yes, yes!’ It’s just so un-English. There are moments when I look around at the collective madness and feel as if I’ve become part of a cult, but I have to make a decision: get embarrassed or go with it. I go with it. As the day goes on, we examine our ‘limiting beliefs’. I identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick. And then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs. I imagine being healthy, energetic and productive, someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong. I imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property. To build on this vision, we’re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives, the moment we felt strongest and most at peace. I think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that I’m proud of. Each time we do we are told to ‘make a move’, so every time we make that move in the future, these memories will come back. I pump my fist in the air, again and again and again. I can’t believe I’m doing it — it’s so not me. I feel as if I’m in the film Rocky. And then the time comes to walk on fire. We’re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park. Robbins is said to have also helped well-known face including Princess Diana (left) and former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (right) A part of me wants to run away, but a bigger part of me knows that I can do this. Then I’m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout: ‘YES!’ I do. They say ‘Make your move!’ and I pump my fist in the air. Then, I go for it. I put my foot on the coals and after that I remember nothing — until my last step, when I could feel heat. I have half-a-second of panic when I realise what I’m doing — but, by then, my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers. It’s done. I’ve walked across a bed of hot coals. Two weeks later, I still cannot answer those questions, but I find myself having the same thoughts as the woman I met in the queue at the start of that day. That strange moment of collective hysteria, when we walked over hot coals, has changed something within me. If I can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet, what else can I do? I’m very keen to find out. To follow Marianne’s self-help journey, go to helpmeblog.net .",

    "document": "Billionaire Paul Allen has created a new company that will launch satellites and people into space from the world's biggest plane. The Microsoft co-founder this week unveiled 'Vulcan Aerospace', which will look after the space programs of Stratolaunch Systems. This includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft (117 metres). Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder this week unveiled 'Vulcan Aerospace', which will look after the space programs of Stratolaunch Systems. This includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft (117 metres) The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. This will then go into orbit as normal and deliver a satellite. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Allen's vision is to create a giant air pad in the sky, allowing payloads to reach space faster and at a lower cost than existing technologies. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft will be powered by six 747-class engines, is currently being assembled at Mojave, California. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. The company will 'shift how the world conceptualises space travel through cost reduction and on‐demand access,' according to Vulcan Aerospace president Chuck Beames who made a presentation in Colorado Springs this week. The Stratolaunch Systems project was inspired by SpaceShipOne which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 for becoming the first privately funded manned vehicle to reach space. 'Stratolaunch's ability to launch from variable locations will enable satellites and humans to be efficiently inserted into their most optimal orbit at a time of the customer's choosing,' Beames wrote. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for Boeing 747-8 . Earlier this year, the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit. Picture is its twin fuselage sections . 'Launching far away from populated areas (i.e. middle of the ocean) also significantly reduces public safety risk. The Stratolaunch carrier plane is on track to make its first test flight in 2016, according to Space.com. The rocket is being developed by Orbital ATK, and the designs uses solid-fuel lower stages and an upper stage powered by RL-10 engines. But according to SpaceNews, Beames indicated that the company is also looking at other launch vehicle options. Wingspan: 385 feet (117 metres) Engines: Six 747-class engines . Fuselage length: 238 feet (72 metres) Weight: 1,200,000 lb (544,311 kg) Maximum speed: 460 knots, 530 mph (850 km/h) Maiden launch: Flight testing will begin in 2016. The first launch of the space launch vehicle is likely to take place in 2018. Satellite delivery: Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Launch sites: Several sites are under consideration, including Kennedy Space Center, Wallops Island and Vandenberg AFB. An animation of the moment the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft delivers a rocket high into Earth's atmosphere before it goes into orbit . Each of the twin fuselages of the the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels . 'What we really want to do is focus on a lower-cost propulsion system that is evolvable in some fashion,' he said. 'We're still looking at Orbital as a potential option,' he said. 'We're widening our aperture to see if this is the right path forward.' Stratolaunch could someday support several launch vehicles, he said. As a result, Stratolaunch said it is temporarily halting work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the Orbital ATK booster. That company added that it is deferring work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the Orbital ATK booster to focus more heavily on getting the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft off the ground. In February. the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane. Its 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the Hughes H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for the Boeing 747-8. Pictured is one of its twin fuslage sections . Rare stills taken from footage shot for a recent news story by KGET 17, a Bakersfield TV station, show its huge size, according to a report by Guy Norris in Aviation Week. Hours after unveiling its next-generation 'Vulcan' rocket this week, United Launch Alliance (ULA), ran into its first problem - the rocket's name. 'Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights,' Chuck Beames, president of the Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Aerospace, told Reuters. 'Paul Allen and Vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of SpaceShipOne more than a decade ago. We are flattered by ULA's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket 'Vulcan',' Beames said. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, selected Vulcan as the name of its new booster, which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019, after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative. 'We have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name Vulcan,' ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email. 'ULA is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so,' she said. The images show one of the two twin fuselage sections under assembly. In the news report, Scaled Composites president Kevin Mickey says the company has so far built 'roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure' for the vehicle. Instead of a satellite, the Stratolaunch airplane could launch a Dream Chaser spaceship, which would be outfitted with an as-yet-unspecified upper-stage rocket motor. 'Dream Chaser seemed to be the logical way to go,' Stratolaunch Executive Director Charles Beames said in October. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the Hughes H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for the Boeing 747-8. Each of the twin fuselages of the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels. Stratolaunch has produced computer-generated images and videos of the aircraft, but the TV footage was the first time images of the real vehicle have been shown. Allen has previously said his project would 'keep America at the forefront of space exploration and give a new generation of children something to dream about'. Several companies are competing to develop spacecraft to deliver cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. The Microsoft billionaire criticised the fact that government-sponsored space programmes are waning. Nasa is paying Boeing and SpaceX to build the capsules and fly them from Cape Canaveral, which hasn't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011. In the news report, Scaled Composites president Kevin Mickey says the company has so far built 'roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure' for the vehicle .

North Korean representatives have confirmed that Kim will be in the Russian capital for May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday, according to Russian state-run news agency Tass. This would mark Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. Kim will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit, Tass reported. Kim's trip has been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation to Pyongyang. Last month, a Russian official speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that the invitation was accepted. But Wednesday's Tass report is the first public confirmation attached to a named official.

Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that former state District Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors. Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher. Baugh sentenced former teacher Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case. At Rambold's August 2013 sentencing, Baugh said Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold, the Billings Gazette reported at the time. Baugh, per the newspaper, described the teenage girl as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth. Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial.

He sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that a 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher . Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence. Legal case: Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old Cherice Moralez (right) shared some responsibility for her rape by teacher Stacey Rambold (left) Baugh, who served almost 30 years as a state judge, stepped down last year after being censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days. He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen.

He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career.

O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month. The former governor, who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines, said that although Clinton is an \"eminently qualified candidate,\" the Democratic Party is full of \"good leaders.\" \"History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa,\" O'Malley said. In some polls, he has scored in the low single digits in the state. In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1% picked O'Malley. In a January poll by Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, O'Malley was also at 1% among Iowa Democrats. Clinton, who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points, is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told CNN on Friday. While he wouldn't say much about Clinton, when asked about her candidacy, O'Malley said, \"if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward, they should run. And they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it.\" O'Malley, like other Democrats, appears to refrain from directly attacking Clinton. Although last month on ABC, he said that the presidency is \"not some crown to be passed between two families,\" he has not focused on her. He has, however, openly teased a presidential run. \"I know that, as Democrats, we expect -- and I have heard this all over the country -- the Democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face,\" he said. \"They believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary.\" He concluded: \"It would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party's nomination for President.\"",

But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go.

Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return.

They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused: Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.",

The former supermodel, who's gearing up for the London marathon on 26 April, told Red Magazine that giving birth has been her toughest physical challenge. And Christy, who suffered a potentially life-threatening complication shortly after the delivery of her daughter Grace, now 11, said today she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever. Scroll down for video . Fitness fanatic: Christy Turlington, pictured last month training for the upcoming London Marathon, says that after experiencing a tricky childbirth, 'anything' seemed possible, including three marathons to date . Christy - who is mother to daughter Grace and son Finn, eight, with her husband of 11 years Edward Burns, 47 - had just given birth to Grace in 2003 when she was struck with a post-partum haemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall. She suffered massive blood loss and was forced to undergo a painful procedure whereby the doctors manually tore her placenta free without pain relief - an experience that could easily have killed her had she not been in such good hands. ‘I actually feel stronger and healthier than ever,' she says. 'Giving birth was probably the most empowering thing I’ve ever done physically. I was like, now I can do anything. I can run a marathon… I can run three marathons!’ Her experience inspired her to launch Every Mother Counts in 2010. 'I guess my own experience of childbirth was the epiphany,’ she says of her decision to launch Every Mother Counts in 2010, an organisation dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers around the world. Getting better with age: The 46-year-old mother-of-two, pictured in 2013 with her kids Finn, eight, and Grace, 11, insists she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever . Good cause: Christy, pictured training her first marathon in 2011, launched Every Mother Counts in 2010, an organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers around the world . Dedicated: According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable - a statistic she's determined to change . She said: ‘What I realised was actually how lucky I had been that so many women don’t even get to choose when they become pregnant.' 'They don’t get to choose whether they will be medicated, or have a natural birth. This is just how it is, and it’s not an ideal way to bring life into the world, I don’t think.’ According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable. But, as she points out, the U.S. is one of the eight countries worldwide where maternal deaths are on the rise. Christy, who became famous alongside Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista in the era of the supermodels, now runs marathons in aid of Every Mother Counts. She said she is determined to strengthen the 'sisterhood' between mothers around the world, wherever the happen to be. Last month, the former face of Calvin Klein was unveiled as the celebrity face of Apple Watch. She appeared in a promotional video to promote the gadget's fitness software, in which she is shown training for a half marathon in Africa, in order to highlight Apple's partnership with Every Mother Counts.

    "document": "Fifteen years ago, Jennifer Lopez' shimmering, navel-baring Versace gown captivated the world . Fifteen years ago, Jennifer Lopez' shimmering, navel-baring Versace gown captivated the world. So much so that, long before Kim Kardashian was breaking the internet, J Lo's 2000 red carpet appearance set the web ablaze. It even caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt, who has revealed that the plunging dress was his inspiration for creating Google Images. 'When Google was launched, people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer,' he told project-syndicate.com. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin – like all other successful inventors – kept iterating, said Schmidt. They started with images, because people wanted more than just text. 'This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world's attention,' added Schmidt. 'At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen. 'But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J Lo wearing that dress. Google Image Search was born.' Before Google Image Search, web surfers could only search through a page of text divided by 10 blue links. This meant they first had to click on these links before finding out if J Lo's dress was featured. When Google Images was launched in July 2001, the site offered access to 250 million images. Just ten year later, that figure reached more than 10 billion. The dress is one of the few articles of specific clothing to be honoured its own Wikipedia page. After hearing the news, the 45-year-old singer shared an old picture of her in that dress on Instagram. She added: 'WHO KNEW!! #onepersoncanchangetheworld #onedresscanchangetheworld #jlo+versace=history #positivechange #funfacts LOL' The dress caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt (pictured), who recently revealed that it was his inspiration for creating Google Images . Google has big plans for its image search. A team of Google researchers recently developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called GoogLeNet, which is twice as effective than previous programs. It is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo. The software recently placed first in the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC). Google has made the software open to other developers, to help increase its accuracy, and in the future, the technology could be used to improve Google Image searches. It could also scour YouTube videos for specific objects or shapes. He may have helped to build the internet, but Dr Vinton ‘Vint’ Cerf has urged computer users to print out their most treasured photographs, or risk losing them. The Google vice president warned that as operating systems and software become more sophisticated, documents and images stored using older technology will become increasingly inaccessible. He went on to say that our dependence on technology could lead to the 21st century being a new dark age in history, with any evidence of our culture lost in a digital 'black hole'. In centuries to come, future historians looking back on the current era could be confronted by a digital desert comparable with the dark ages - the post-Roman period in Western Europe about which relatively little is known because of the scarcity of written records. Dr Cerf, who also has the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, said: ‘If we’re thinking 1,000 years, 3,000 years ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create? ‘We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it.'",

    "document": "The boy dubbed China's 'miracle baby' after he was born the moment his mother was killed in a horrific car crash has just celebrated his first birthday. Zhao Pingan's mother was in labour when she and her husband were hit by a truck as they travelled on a motorbike to a hospital in Xiamen city, in south-eastern China's Fujian province. Both of his parents were killed in the accident, but not before the mother gave birth at the scene last March, reports The People's Daily. Pingan Zhao (pictured) was named China's 'miracle baby' after he was born as his mother died in a crash . Chinese media reported at the time that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb' as the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. This unbelievable story of his birth led to him becoming something of a local celebrity and hailed as a 'miracle baby'. The baby was given the name Zhao Pingan which means 'safe and sound' in Chinese. Pingan was then adopted by his uncle Zhao Yanchao and his grandmother Xiao Kaixing. On Saturday, Pingan celebrated his first birthday publicly - about a month after his real birthday of March 18 - in his hometown Xiamen, surrounded by family members and the volunteers and doctors who treated him at the time. Uncle Yanchao said: 'I lost my older brother to an absolute tragedy, now I have a duty to see him live on in Pingan. Chinese media reported that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb (left) when the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. Pingan (right) celebrates his first birthday with his family . Pimgan was dubbed China's 'miracle baby' by local media after his miraculous start in life (pictured) 'He already has his eyes and his mother's smile. I shall love and treasure him as I know they would have done.' To celebrate his birthday his aunt, Ms Zhang, in keeping with Pingan's native Sichuan tradition, gave some items for the little boy to 'hold on to' to determine his future. He immediately took a calculator, pen and an apple. 'These three items indicates Pingan will safely proceed with his studies and he will have a deep interest in learning.' said a smiling Ms Zhang. When Pingan was seven months old he was taken Beijing's Tiantan Hospital Neurosurgery department to have an operation to drain the build-up of water in his head. A doctor said because of Pingan's injuries his development may be a bit behind his peers, especially in his speech and ability to walk. Pingan enjoys a piece of cake as he celebrates his first birthday one year on from the horror crash . But despite his difficult start in life Pingan has developed into a happy and smiling little boy. Now Pingan's uncle and aunty are preparing to move and work away from home in order to bring in more money as they are concerned about the ongoing treatment he will need. 'Pingan may still need further operations,' said his uncle Zhao Yanchao. Baby Pingan suffered from minor bruises and scratches when he was found at the scene of the accident last year. Police spokesman Chan Chien said at the time: 'Eye witnesses said that when the woman was hit by the truck she gave birth on the spot. ' Pingan is a happy little boy - but his family are concerned he could require further hospital treatment for the injuries he received in the crash . 'Others said that the baby which was a healthy 4.2 kg had been thrown out of the woman's belly and had landed three meters away.' Police confirmed soon after the accident that they had arrested a 45-year-old truck driver who had apparently turned into the road just as the motorbike was coming along. A spokesman from Beiiing Tian Tan Hospital said shortly after the accident: 'The baby has had an MRI scan because he is suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, which was caused by the accident. 'He will need to undergo more surgery although we do not think his condition is serious. 'He truly is a miracle baby.' Xiamen City Hospital Paediatrician Dr Fang Mei, who treated Pingan at the time, said on Saturday: 'When he first arrived he was covered in dirt with cuts to his head.' 'Weighing over 9lb the baby boy still had his umbilical cord and placenta attached to him when he arrived at the hospital.' Dr Fang said that as Pingan had hit the floor quite hard he had sustained some nerve damage to his fragile body. She said: 'None of the medical staff had seen how Pingan was pushed out of his mother's body and we wonder how it could have been possible - but the fact that he survived is something of a miracle.' Pingan's plight moved the nation and volunteers and charities flocked to offer their time and help with his recovery. Two branches of the Red Cross in Xiamen City set up a '3.18 Hai Cang Miracle Baby Fund' and were able to find 50 'Loving Mummies' to provide him with round the clock care and attention. The head of a local charity volunteer group, Ms Li, said they set up a call to action movement to help the miracle baby and were 'overwhelmed' by the response. Nappies, toys, as well as expertise and time were all donated to Pingan. The baby poses with some of the hospital staff and volunteers who helped care for him following the crash . Pingan is pictured with his uncle on his first birthday - his uncle is now planning to move away in order to earn enough money to look after the baby and pay for any further medical treatment he may need .",

    "document": "A surrender order issued by Hitler's successor in the final days of the Second World War that was found on the chief of the Luftwaffe when he was arrested is being auctioned 70 years later for £21,000. The typed dispatch – owned by a US collector – was sent by German president Karl Doenitz on May 8, 1945, telling officers to abandon fighting or face the Allies' wrath. It was seized from Luftwaffe chief Robert von Greim when he was arrested that day. The WWI fighter ace then killed himself rather than be tortured by the Russians. The surrender order that is being auctioned is being auctioned by Bonhams, New York . The typed order sent by German president Karl Doenitz is expected to fetch £21,000 when it goes under the hammer . Grand Admiral Doenitz had been Hitler's choice to replace him as leader of the Nazis, a role he assumed following the dictator's suicide on April 30. But a week later, amid a crumbling and defeated Reich, Doenitz met with Allied commanders to sign the instrument of surrender, bringing an end to war in Europe. The following day Doenitz, who had been commander of the German navy up until Hitler's death, sent a telex message to his commanders in the field informing them of the immediate surrender 'to save as many people as possible for Germany'. Describing the action as 'unavoidable', Doenitz instructed officers to abandon all fighting or face the wrath of the Allies. The note read: 'On 7 May 1945 0241, the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht signed the unconditional surrender of all armed forces on land, on water, and in the air to the Supreme Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces as well as the Soviet Supreme Command. 'This was unavoidable in order to prevent the complete destruction of certain parts of the front, which was expected to occur in a short time, and, in doing so, to save as many people as possible for Germany. 'Accordingly, on 9 May 1945 0100 GST every ongoing combat activity must be abandoned. 'All officers of the army, navy and the Luftwaffe, as well as troops of the Wehrmacht divisions and the Waffen SS shall remain in their current positions. 'Effective immediately, no maritime vehicle or aeroplane shall be sunk or destroyed, no military equipment may be damaged in any way.' He finished the message with a stark warning that if his officers 'do not act according to the conditions of surrender, the Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and Soviet Command will undertake punitive measures or other steps beyond the conditions of surrender.' Von Greim, 52, a WWI fighter ace, had been put in charge of the Luftwaffe after Hitler turned on Herman Goering accusing him of treason. Railing against his former comrades, Hitler summoned von Greim to Berlin and ordered him to hunt down and kill Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler who he believed had tried to harbour a peace deal with the Allies. The order was seized from Luftwaffe chief Robert von Greim when he was arrested that day . Von Greim escaped Berlin in a camouflaged plane and his actions thereafter are unknown until he was arrested in Austria by US troops on May 8. On his arrest, Von Greim admitted to his captors: 'I am the head of the Luftwaffe, but I have no Luftwaffe'. He was taken to Salzburg and was due to be handed over to the Soviets but committed suicide by taking a cyanide pill on May 24. The note is one of the only copies of Doenitz's dispatch known to exist today. It is tipped to fetch £21,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auction house on behalf of a private collector from the US. Tom Lamb, an expert in military history at Bonhams, said: 'The story behind this document is an incredible one. 'Hitler was in his bunker in Berlin a few days prior to his death and he called von Greim, one of his closest and most trusted allies. 'Von Greim was flown in to Berlin amid all the fighting. That evening Hitler launched a rant about how his right hand man Heinrich Himmler had betrayed him. 'Hitler ordered von Greim to go and kill Himmler for treason then take control of the Luftwaffe following the treason of Goering. 'Von Greim left immediately in his camouflaged plane and amazingly managed to escape out of Berlin without being caught. 'He was supposed to go to Plon in northern Germany to track down Himmler but he was arrested on May 8, the same day as the German surrender, by US troops in Austria. 'Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier and Admiral Doenitz had taken charge. On May 7 1945 Doenitz had signed the instrument of surrender and the following day he sent his high command a dispatch informing them. 'Doenitz warned that if the Germans didn't stop fighting they would be killed by the Americans or the Russians. 'He understood the end had come and he was telling his high command to make sure everyone knew that. 'The telegram from Doenitz was found on Von Griem when he was arrested. 'Von Greim was then taken to Salzburg where he was due to be part of a Soviet-US prisoner exchange but fearing torture at the hands of Stalin he took his own life with a cyanide pill. 'Copies of the surrender note from Doenitz are exceptionally rare - many were lost or destroyed but somehow this one survived. 'This document is incredibly important in the history of the 20th century.' The auction will take place in New York on April 29.",

    "document": "A Conservative party candidate has defended photographs which show him trying to lick a female friend's breasts saying they were taken on a night out with friends and show him being a normal, sociable person. Liam Marshall-Ascough is standing to be an MP in Stoke-on-Trent central, which had a 5,500 Labour majority in 2010, and is a traditional Labour stronghold. The candidate, who is gay, is pictured on the open profile of his Facebook page appearing to lick a female friend's breasts. Underneath the picture a friend commented 'drunko'. But Mr Marshall-Ascough has insisted the photos, taken seven years ago, just show him out having fun with close friends 'like a normal person' and do not undermine his ability to do the job. He also said they show he is able to interact with people - important to the role of a politician. Liam Marshall-Ascough, pictured seven years ago on a night out with a close friend, insists the pictures show him enjoying himself like any normal person in their twenties and do not undermine his ability to do the job . 'You are still allowed to go out with your friends,' he told MailOnline. 'I think it's really important that you have a balance. You are not just about politics, but you actually interact with people. 'You can balance your social life and your professional life' Other photographs show him out drinking and posing with several female friends under the title 'more random nights out', and with and colleagues at Virgin Atlantic where he works as a steward. Mr Marshall-Ascough is also seen posing with David Cameron and outside the front door of Number 10, in pictures on the site. 'I'm a normal person,' he added in response to claims that some people felt the pictures showed a lack of judgement and responsibility. 'I grew up in a council house and I have a job that's cabin crew. It's a very sociable job and I'm a very sociable person. 'I think that's important. 'One of the things that I love about being cabin crew is you get to interact with people from every walk of life, and I think that's really important to the job of a politician. 'People want politicians these days who are normal people.' Mr Marshall-Ascough is a Conservative candidate for Stoke-on-Trent central, a traditional Labour stronghold . Several photographs show Mr Marshall-Ascough enjoyong nights out with his friends . Mr Marshall-Ascough, now 35, said the pictures had been taken seven years ago when he was out with close friends and was enjoying himself like most people in their twenties. He also added that he is not drinking to excess in any of the pictures, or doing anything wrong. 'I don't hide the fact I'm a normal person, and people want politicians who are normal,' he added. 'I'm definitely not going out at the moment. I'm too busy. 'You have to remember these pictures were taken in my twenties, when I was out like other people. Now I am in my thirties. 'Sometimes you make misjudgements when you are younger and you learn from these and grow up, using these experiences.' Mr Marshall-Ascough said he is able to balance his personal and professional life to interact with people . The Crawley borough councillor hasn't used any privacy settings on his social media profile, so the images are viewable by the public. The 35-year-old has also recently been seen on the campaign trail, supporting other Conservative party candidates. He faces a challenge to get elected in his constituency, which has been a Labour stronghold since the 1950s. His female friend, who appears in one of the photos but did not want to be named, said: 'It was taken seven years ago and it was harmless fun. It just happens to be a picture taken out of context. There was nothing untoward. It was all very innocent and Liam is a really professional person.' Mr Marshall-Ascough courted controversy last year when he told his local newspaper that he did not believe there was a cost of living crisis. He said he felt an extra food bank was not needed in the borough because he believed there was no food poverty, as shown by the fact it was 'difficult' to book a table in Crawley on a Friday or Saturday evening. Mr Marshall-Ascough, who studied Archaeology and History at the University of Southampton, made a start in politics in 2012 when he was elected to the council. He was picked as the Conservative party candidate for Stoke-on Trent in October last year and insisted he will not be standing down as a councillor for Southgate, where he has a seat until 2016. He also insisted that residents of Southgate - located almost 200 miles from Stoke-on-Trent, will not suffer if he is elected as an MP. He described being chosen to stand as an MP as 'an honour and a privilege'.",

    "document": "Sean Heslop, pictured, has been suspended as executive principal of two schools over allegations that a former pupil is expecting his baby . One of Britain’s top headmasters has been arrested after he allegedly began a relationship with a former pupil now said to be pregnant with his child. Cambridge-educated Sean Heslop, 47, was questioned on suspicion of abusing his position of trust after claims about the affair came to light last month. Mr Heslop, who separated from his wife last year, has been suspended from his job as executive principal of two academy schools in Kent. But a family member claimed he was ‘the happiest he’s ever been’ as he was looking forward to becoming a father this summer. The former pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, became pregnant at the end of last year after leaving school and starting at a London university. The woman, who is now 18, described herself as a ‘mummy-to-be’ on one social media page and posted online a picture of the three-month scan of her unborn child. She wrote that she was ‘in a loving relationship’ and had a lot of support, but said some people were quick to judge her because she was a pregnant teenager. The ex-pupil recounted in a blog how her former headmaster came to visit her at university after she began her degree last September. Mr Heslop split from his Canadian wife Celine, 44, in the autumn after nine years of marriage. He has not been seen at the £850,000 home they shared in Battersea, south-west London, for several months. ‘Sean is the happiest he’s ever been because he’s going to be a dad. They are really excited and he is so happy to be a father,’ an unnamed relative told The Sun. Mr Heslop was educated at Queens’ College, Cambridge, before completing a teacher-training course at King’s College London. The woman, a former pupil at one of the schools Mr Heslop was in charge of, has reportedly been boasting online to friends that she is going to be a mother (pictured, a scan of her child) Despite the police investigation, Mr Heslop is 'the happiest he has ever been' according to sources close to him because he is 'going to be a father' He worked as an English teacher at a top grammar school in Barnet, north London, before becoming head of English at another leading grammar in Orpington, south London. In 2004, he was appointed head of Tiffin boys’ grammar in Kingston, south-west London. Under his leadership it was one of the first schools in the country to be rated ‘outstanding’ in every category by Ofsted. While there he was criticised by some parents for dramatically reducing the amount of homework given to pupils, so they would have more time to develop their own interests. There was also controversy after it emerged the school had spent all of its £800,000 reserves in four years, plunging it into financial crisis. In 2009, he took over the running of the Folkestone Academy in Kent on a salary estimated at more than £100,000 a year. He was also given responsibility for the Marlowe Academy in nearby Ramsgate at the end of 2013. The 47-year-old has been questioned by detectives over allegations of abuse of trust and has been released on police bail . Mr Heslop was appointed as executive principal at the Marlowe Academy in Ramsgate Kent, pictured, in 2013 . Parents of pupils at the two schools were informed of his suspension in letters last week, but were not told the reason. The governors said in a statement: ‘The executive principal of the Folkestone and Marlowe Academies has been suspended from his duties. An investigation remains ongoing, the nature of which is confidential. ‘This has not interfered with and will not inhibit the good work going on in the schools, where the respective head teachers and their senior leadership teams ensure that teaching and other school activities continue as normal and that school routine is unaffected.’ A Kent Police spokesman said: ‘On March 31 police arrested a 47-year-old man on suspicion of abuse of a position of trust. ‘He was later released on bail until July 30 pending further investigation.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",
